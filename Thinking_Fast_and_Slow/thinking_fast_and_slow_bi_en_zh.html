<p class ="en"> Every  author, I suppose, has in mind a setting in which readers of his or her work could benefit from having read it. Mine is the proverbial office water-cooler, where opinions are shared and gossip is exchanged. I hope to enrich the vocabulary that people use when they talk about the judgments and choices of others, the company’s new policies, or a colleague’s investment decisions.  Why be concerned with gossip? Because it is much easier, as well as far more enjoyable, to identify and label the mistakes of others than to recognize our own. Questioning what we believe and want is difficult at the best of times, and especially difficult when we most need to do it, but we can benefit from the informed opinions of others. Many of us spontaneously anticipate how friends and colleagues  will evaluate our choices; the quality and content of these anticipated judgments therefore matters. The expectation of intelligent gossip is a powerful motive for serious self-criticism, more powerful than New Year resolutions to improve one’s decision making at work and at home. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 我想，每一位 的作者，心中都有一个环境，让他或她的作品的读者能够从阅读中受益。我希望能丰富人们在谈论他人的判断和选择、公司的新政策或同事的投资决定时使用的词汇。  ，为什么要关注八卦？因为识别和标示别人的错误比认识自己的错误要容易得多，也愉快得多。 在最好的时候，质疑我们所相信和想要的东西是很困难的，在我们最需要这样做的时候尤其困难，但我们可以从别人的知情意见中受益。我们中的许多人自发地预期朋友和同事  ，将如何评价我们的选择；因此这些预期判断的质量和内容很重要。对智能八卦的期待是严肃自我批评的强大动机，比改善自己在工作和家庭中的决策的新年决议更有力。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> To be a good diagnostician, a physician needs to acquire a large set of labels for diseases, each of which binds  an idea of the illness and its symptoms, possible antecedents and causes, possible developments and consequences, and possible interventions to cure or mitigate the illness. Learning medicine consists in part of learning the language of medicine. A deeper understanding of judgments and choices also requires a richer vocabulary than is available in everyday language. The hope for informed gossip is  that there are distinctive patterns in the errors people make. Systematic errors  are known as biases, and they recur predictably in particular circumstances. When the handsome and confident speaker bounds onto the stage, for example, you can anticipate that the audience will judge his comments more favorably than he deserves. The availability of a diagnostic label for this bias—the halo effect—makes  it easier to anticipate, recognize, and understand. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 为了成为一名优秀的诊断师，医生需要掌握一大套疾病的标签，每一个标签都绑定了  ，对疾病及其症状、可能的前因和原因、可能的发展和后果以及可能的干预措施来治愈或减轻疾病的想法。 学习医学部分包括学习医学的语言。对判断和选择的深入理解也需要比日常语言更丰富的词汇。对知情的流言蜚语的希望是：  ，在人们所犯的错误中存在着独特的模式。系统性错误 被称为偏见，它们在特定情况下可预测地重复出现。例如，当英俊而自信的演讲者跳上舞台时，你可以预见到观众会对他的评论作出比他应得的更有利的评价。有了这种偏见的诊断标签--光环效应，  ，就更容易预测、识别和理解。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> When you are asked what you are thinking about, you can normally answer. You believe you know what goes on in your mind, which often consists of one conscious thought leading in an orderly way to another. But that is not the only way the mind works, nor indeed is that the typical way. Most impressions and thoughts arise in your conscious experience  without your knowing how they got there. You cannot trace how you came to the belief that there is a lamp on the desk in front of you, or how you detected a hint of irritation in your spouse’s voice on the telephone, or how you managed to avoid a threat on the road before you became consciously aware of it. The mental work that produces impressions, intuitions, and many decisions goes on in  silence in our mind. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 当你被问及你在想什么时，你通常可以回答。 你相信你知道你的头脑中发生了什么，这往往是由一个有意识的想法以一种有序的方式引导到另一个。但这并不是心灵工作的唯一方式，实际上也不是典型的方式。大多数印象和想法都出现在你的意识经验中，  ，而你并不知道它们是如何到达的。你无法追踪你是如何相信你面前的桌子上有一盏灯的，或者你是如何在电话中察觉到你配偶声音中的一丝烦躁的，或者在你有意识地意识到之前，你是如何设法避开路上的威胁的。 产生印象、直觉和许多决定的心理工作在我们的头脑中  沉默地进行。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Much of the discussion in this book is about biases of intuition. However, the focus on error does not denigrate human intelligence, any more than the attention to diseases in medical texts denies good health. Most of us are healthy most of the time, and most of our judgments and actions are appropriate most of the time. As we navigate our lives, we normally allow ourselves  to be guided by impressions and feelings, and the confidence we have in our intuitive beliefs and preferences is usually justified. But not always. We are often confident even when we are wrong, and an objective observer is more likely to detect our errors than we are. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 本书中的大部分讨论都是关于直觉的偏见。 然而，对错误的关注并没有诋毁人类的智慧，就像医学著作中对疾病的关注否认了健康一样。 我们大多数人在大多数时候都是健康的，我们的大多数判断和行动在大多数时候都是合适的。在我们的生活中，我们通常允许自己  ，以印象和感觉为指导，我们对自己的直觉信念和偏好的信心通常是合理的。 但并不总是如此。我们往往在错误的时候也很自信，而客观的观察者比我们更容易发现我们的错误。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> So this is my aim for watercooler conversations: improve the ability to identify and understand errors of judgment and choice,  in others and eventually in ourselves, by providing a richer and more precise language to discuss them. In at least some cases, an accurate diagnosis may suggest an intervention to limit the damage that bad judgments and choices often cause. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 因此，这是我在水杯对话中的目标：通过提供更丰富、更精确的语言来讨论，提高识别和理解判断和选择错误的能力，  ，最终在我们自己身上。 至少在某些情况下，准确的诊断可能会建议进行干预，以限制错误判断和选择经常造成的损害。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> This book presents my current understanding of judgment and decision making, which has been shaped by psychological discoveries of recent decades.  However, I trace the central ideas to the lucky day in 1969 when I asked a colleague to speak as a guest to a seminar I was teaching in the Department  of Psychology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Amos Tversky was considered a rising star in the field of decision research—indeed, in anything he did—so I knew we would have an interesting time. Many people who knew Amos thought he was the  most intelligent person they had ever met. He was brilliant, voluble, and charismatic. He was also blessed with a perfect memory for jokes and an exceptional ability to use them to make a point. There was never a dull moment when Amos was around. He was then thirty-two; I was thirty-five. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 本书介绍了我目前对判断和决策的理解，这种理解是由近几十年来的心理学发现形成的。  然而，我把中心思想追溯到1969年的幸运日，当时我请一位同事作为嘉宾在我在耶路撒冷希伯来大学心理学系 的研讨会上发言。Amos Tversky被认为是决策研究领域的一颗新星--事实上，在他所做的任何事情上--所以我知道我们会有一段有趣的时间。 许多认识Amos的人认为他是他们所见过的最聪明的人  。他才华横溢，侃侃而谈，魅力十足。他还得天独厚地拥有完美的笑话记忆力，以及利用笑话来表达观点的非凡能力。当阿莫斯在身边的时候，从来没有一个沉闷的时刻。 他当时是32岁，我是35岁。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Amos told the class about an ongoing program of research at the University of Michigan that sought to answer  this question: Are people good intuitive statisticians? We already knew that people are good intuitive grammarians: at age four a child effortlessly conforms to the rules of grammar as she speaks, although she has no idea that such rules exist. Do people have a similar intuitive feel for the basic principles of statistics? Amos reported that the answer was a qualified yes. We had a lively debate  in the seminar and ultimately concluded that a qualified no was a better answer. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 阿莫斯在课堂上讲述了密歇根大学正在进行的一项研究计划，该计划试图回答  这个问题：人们是好的直觉统计学家吗？我们已经知道人们是好的直觉语法学家：四岁的孩子在说话时毫不费力地符合语法规则，尽管她不知道这种规则存在。人们对统计学的基本原理有类似的直观感受吗？阿莫斯报告说，答案是有条件的肯定。我们在研讨会上进行了热烈的辩论  ，最终得出结论，有条件的否定是更好的答案。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Amos and I enjoyed the exchange and concluded that intuitive statistics was an interesting topic and that it would be fun to explore it together. That Friday we met for lunch at Café Rimon, the favorite hangout of bohemians and professors in Jerusalem, and planned a study of the statistical intuitions of sophisticated  researchers. We had concluded in the seminar that our own intuitions were deficient. In spite of years of teaching and using statistics, we had not developed an intuitive sense of the reliability of statistical results observed in small samples. Our subjective judgments were biased: we were far too willing to believe research findings based on inadequate evidence and  prone to collect too few observations  in our own research. The goal of our study was to examine whether other researchers suffered from the same affliction. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 阿莫斯和我很喜欢这种交流，并得出结论，直觉统计是一个有趣的话题，一起探讨它将会很有趣。那个星期五，我们在里蒙咖啡馆（Café Rimon）共进午餐，这是耶路撒冷的波希米亚人和教授们最喜欢去的地方，并计划对复杂的  研究人员的统计直觉进行研究。我们在研讨会上得出结论，我们自己的直觉是有缺陷的。尽管多年来一直在教授和使用统计学，但我们对在小样本中观察到的统计结果的可靠性并没有形成一种直观的感觉。我们的主观判断是有偏见的：我们太愿意相信基于不充分证据的研究结果，并 容易 在自己的研究中 收集太少的观察  。我们研究的目的是检查其他研究人员是否遭受同样的困扰。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> We prepared a survey that included realistic scenarios of statistical issues that arise in research. Amos collected the responses of a group of expert participants in a meeting of the Society of Mathematical Psychology, including the authors of two statistical textbooks. As expected,  we found that our expert colleagues, like us, greatly exaggerated the likelihood that the original result of an experiment would be successfully replicated even with a small sample. They also gave very poor advice to a fictitious graduate student about the number of observations she needed to collect. Even statisticians were not good intuitive statisticians. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 我们准备了一份调查，其中包括研究中出现的统计问题的现实情景。 阿莫斯收集了一组参加数学心理学会会议的专家的答复，其中包括两本统计学教科书的作者。正如预期的那样，  ，我们发现我们的专家同事和我们一样，大大夸大了实验的原始结果被成功复制的可能性，即使是小样本。他们也给一个虚构的研究生提供了非常糟糕的建议，告诉她需要收集的观测数据的数量。 即使是统计学家也不是好的直觉统计学家。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> While writing the article that reported  these findings, Amos and I discovered that we enjoyed working together. Amos was always very funny,  and in his presence I became funny as well, so we spent hours of solid work in continuous amusement. The pleasure we found in working together made us exceptionally patient; it is much easier to strive for perfection when you are never bored. Perhaps most important, we checked our critical weapons  at the door. Both Amos and I were critical and argumentative, he even more than I, but during the years of our collaboration neither of us ever rejected out of hand anything the other said. Indeed, one of the great joys I found in the collaboration was that Amos frequently saw the point of my vague ideas much more clearly than I did. Amos was the more logical thinker, with an orientation to theory  and an unfailing sense of direction. I was more intuitive and rooted in the psychology of perception, from which we borrowed many ideas. We were sufficiently similar to understand each other easily, and sufficiently different to surprise each other. We developed a routine in which we spent much of our working days together, often on long walks. For the next fourteen years our collaboration was  the focus of our lives, and the work we did together during those years was the best either of us ever did. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> We quickly adopted a practice that we maintained for many years. Our research was a conversation, in which we invented questions and jointly examined our intuitive answers. Each question was a small experiment, and we carried out many experiments in a single day. We were not seriously looking  for the correct answer to the statistical questions we posed. Our aim was to identify and analyze the intuitive answer, the first one that came to mind, the one we were tempted to make even when we knew it to be wrong. We believed—correctly, as it happened—that any intuition that the two of us shared would be shared by many other people as well, and that it would be easy to demonstrate its  effects on judgments. </p></div>

We could identify the argumentative three-year-old lawyer, the nerdy professor, the empathetic and mildly intrusive psychotherapist. Of course these predictions were absurd, but we still found them appealing. It was also clear that our intuitions  were governed by the resemblance of each child to the cultural stereotype of a profession. The amusing exercise helped us develop a theory that was emerging in our minds at the time, about the role of resemblance in predictions. We went on to test and elaborate that theory in dozens of experiments, as in the following example. </p></div>

Here again, the reliance on a heuristic produces a predictable bias in judgments. For example, I recently came to doubt my long-held impression that adultery is more common among politicians than among physicians  or lawyers. I had even come up with explanations for that “fact,” including the aphrodisiac effect of power and the temptations of life away from home.

<p class ="en"> Historians of science have often noted that at any given time scholars in a particular  field tend to share basic assumptions about their subject. Social scientists are no exception; they rely on a view of human nature that provides the background of most discussions of specific behaviors but is rarely questioned. Social scientists in the 1970s broadly accepted two ideas about human nature. First, people are generally rational, and their thinking is normally sound. Second, emotions  such as fear, affection, and hatred explain most of the occasions on which people depart from rationality. Our article challenged both assumptions without discussing them directly. We documented systematic errors in the thinking of normal people, and we traced these errors to the design of the machinery of cognition rather than to the corruption of thought by emotion. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> For example, students of policy have noted that the availability heuristic helps explain why some issues are highly salient in the public’s mind while others are neglected. People tend to assess the relative importance of issues by the ease with which they are retrieved from memory—and this is largely determined by the extent of coverage in the media. Frequently mentioned  topics populate the mind even as others slip away from awareness. In turn, what the media choose to report corresponds to their view of what is currently  on the public’s mind. It is no accident that authoritarian regimes exert substantial pressure on independent media. Because public interest is most easily aroused by dramatic events and by celebrities, media feeding frenzies are common. For several  weeks after Michael Jackson’s death, for example, it was virtually impossible to find a television channel reporting on another topic. In contrast, there is little coverage of critical but unexciting issues that provide less drama, such as declining educational standards or overinvestment of medical resources in the last year of life. (As I write this, I notice that my choice of “little-covered”  examples was guided by availability. The topics I chose as examples are mentioned often; equally important issues that are less available did not come to my mind.) </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 例如，研究政策的学生已经注意到，可用性启发式有助于解释为什么有些问题在公众心目中非常突出，而其他问题却被忽视。 人们倾向于通过从记忆中检索问题的难易程度来评估问题的相对重要性--这主要由媒体的报道程度决定。经常被提及的  ，甚至当其他话题从人们的意识中溜走时，媒体选择报道的内容与他们对当前公众心目中 的看法相一致。专制政权对独立媒体施加巨大压力并非偶然。 由于公众的兴趣最容易被戏剧性事件和名人所激发，媒体的狂欢很常见。例如，在迈克尔-杰克逊去世后的几个  ，几乎不可能找到一个电视频道来报道其他话题。相比之下，对那些关键但不刺激的问题，如教育标准的下降或生命最后一年医疗资源的过度投资，却鲜有报道。（当我写到这里时，我注意到我选择 "鲜有报道 "的  例子是由可用性引导的。我选择的主题作为例子经常被提及；同样重要的问题，却没有出现在我的脑海中）。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The use of demonstrations provided scholars from diverse disciplines—notably philosophers and economists—an unusual opportunity to observe possible flaws in their own thinking. Having seen themselves fail, they became more likely to question the dogmatic assumption, prevalent at the time, that the human mind is rational and logical. The choice of method was crucial:  if we had reported results of only conventional experiments, the article would have been less noteworthy and less memorable. Furthermore, skeptical readers would have distanced themselves from the results by attributing judgment errors to the familiar fecklessness of undergraduates, the typical participants in psychological studies. Of course, we did not choose demonstrations over standard experiments  because we wanted to influence philosophers and economists. We preferred demonstrations because they were more fun, and we were lucky in our choice of method as well as in many other ways. A recurrent theme of this book is that luck plays a large role in every story of success; it is almost always easy to identify a small change in the story that would have turned a remarkable achievement into  a mediocre outcome.

<p class ="en"> Immediately after completing our review of judgment, we switched our attention to decision making under uncertainty. Our goal was to develop a psychological theory of how people make decisions about simple gambles. For example: Would you accept a bet on  the toss of a coin where you win $130 if the coin shows heads and lose $100 if it shows tails? These elementary choices had long been used to examine broad questions about decision making, such as the relative weight that people assign to sure things and to uncertain outcomes. Our method did not change: we spent many days making up choice problems and examining whether our intuitive preferences  conformed to the logic of choice. Here again, as in judgment, we observed systematic biases in our own decisions, intuitive preferences that consistently violated the rules of rational choice. Five years after the  Science  article, we published “Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision Under Risk,” a theory of choice that is by some counts more influential than our work on judgment, and is one  of the foundations of behavioral economics. </p></div>

Instead, he had listened to his intuition; he liked the cars, he liked the company, and he liked the idea of owning its stock.

<p class ="en"> When confronted with a problem—choosing a chess move or deciding whether to invest in a stock—the machinery of intuitive thought does the best it can. If the individual has relevant expertise, she will recognize the situation, and the intuitive solution that comes to  her mind is likely to be correct. This is what happens when a chess master looks at a complex position: the few moves that immediately occur to him are all strong. When the question is difficult and a skilled solution is not available, intuition still has a shot: an answer may come to mind quickly—but it is not an answer to the original question. The question that the executive faced (should I invest  in Ford stock?) was difficult, but the answer to an easier and related question (do I like Ford cars?) came readily to his mind and determined his choice. This is the essence of intuitive heuristics: when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually  without noticing the substitution . </p></div>

For reasons that I explain more fully in the next chapter, I describe mental life by the metaphor of two agents, called System 1 and System 2, which respectively produce fast and slow thinking.  I speak of the features of intuitive and deliberate thought as if they were traits and dispositions of two characters in your mind. In the picture that emerges from recent research, the intuitive System 1 is more influential than your experience tells you, and it is the secret author of many of the choices and judgments you make.

It elaborates the distinction between the automatic operations of System 1 and the controlled operations of System 2, and shows how associative memory, the core of System 1, continually constructs a coherent interpretation  of what is going on in our world at any instant. I attempt to give a sense of the complexity and richness of the automatic and often unconscious processes that underlie intuitive thinking, and of how these automatic processes explain the heuristics of judgment. A goal is to introduce a language for thinking and talking about the mind. </p></div>

We are prone to overestimate how much we understand about the world and to underestimate the role of chance in events. Overconfidence is fed by the illusory certainty of hindsight. My views on this topic have been influenced by  Nassim Taleb, the author of  The Black Swan .

This section  of the book provides a current view, informed by the two-system model, of the key concepts of prospect theory, the model of choice that Amos and I published in 1979. Subsequent chapters address several ways human choices deviate from the rules of rationality. I deal with the unfortunate tendency to treat problems in isolation, and with framing effects, where decisions are shaped by inconsequential  features of choice problems. These observations, which are readily explained by the features of System 1, present a deep challenge to the rationality assumption favored in standard economics. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Part 5  describes recent research that has introduced a distinction between two selves, the experiencing self and the remembering self, which do not have the same interests. For example, we can expose people  to two painful experiences. One of these experiences is strictly worse than the other, because it is longer. But the automatic formation of memories—a feature of System 1—has its rules, which we can exploit so that the worse episode leaves a better memory. When people later choose which episode to repeat, they are, naturally, guided by their remembering self and expose themselves (their experiencing  self) to unnecessary pain. The distinction between two selves is applied to the measurement of well-being, where we find again that what makes the experiencing self happy is not quite the same as what satisfies the remembering self. How two selves within a single body can pursue happiness raises some difficult questions, both for individuals and for societies that view the well-being of the  population as a policy objective. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In all these situations you must pay attention, and you will perform less well, or not at all, if you are not ready or if your attention is directed inappropriately. System 2 has some ability to change the way System 1 works, by programming the normally automatic functions of attention and  memory. When waiting for a relative at a busy train station, for example, you can set yourself at will to look for a white-haired woman or a bearded man, and thereby increase the likelihood of detecting your relative from a distance. You can set your memory to search for capital cities that start with  N  or for French existentialist novels. And when you rent a car at London’s Heathrow Airport,  the attendant will probably remind you that “we drive on the left side of the road over here.” In all these cases, you are asked to do something that does not come naturally, and you will find that the consistent maintenance of a set requires continuous exertion of at least some effort. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 在所有这些情况下，你必须注意，如果你没有准备好，或者你的注意力被不适当地引导，你就会表现得不那么好，或者根本没有表现。 系统2有一些能力改变系统1的工作方式，通过对注意力和  记忆的正常自动功能进行编程。例如，当你在繁忙的火车站等待亲戚时，你可以随意设置自己寻找白发女人或大胡子男人，从而增加从远处发现亲戚的可能性。 你可以设置你的记忆来搜索以 N 开头的首都或法国存在主义小说。 当你在伦敦希思罗机场租车时，  ，服务员可能会提醒你，"我们在这里靠道路的左边行驶"。在所有这些情况下，你被要求做一些不自然的事情，而且你会发现，持续保持一套要求至少持续付出一些努力。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The often-used phrase “pay attention” is apt: you dispose of a limited budget of attention that you can allocate  to activities, and if you try to go beyond your budget, you will fail. It is the mark of effortful activities that they interfere with each other, which is why it is difficult or impossible to conduct several at once. You could not compute the product of 17 × 24 while making a left turn into dense traffic, and you certainly should not try. You can do several things at once, but only if they  are easy and undemanding. You are probably safe carrying on a conversation with a passenger while driving on an empty highway, and many parents have discovered, perhaps with some guilt, that they can read a story to a child while thinking of something else. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Intense focusing on a task can make people effectively blind, even to stimuli that normally attract attention. The most dramatic demonstration  was offered by Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons in their book  The Invisible Gorilla . They constructed a short film of two teams passing basketballs, one team wearing white shirts, the other wearing black. The viewers of the film are instructed to count the number of passes made by the white team, ignoring the black players. This task is difficult and completely absorbing. Halfway through  the video, a woman wearing a gorilla suit appears, crosses the court, thumps her chest, and moves on. The gorilla is in view for  9 seconds. Many thousands of people have seen the video, and about half of them do not notice anything unusual. It is the counting task—and especially the instruction to ignore one of the teams—that causes the blindness. No one who watches the video without that task  would miss the gorilla. Seeing and orienting are automatic functions of System 1, but they depend on the allocation of some attention to the relevant stimulus. The authors note that the most remarkable observation of their study is that people find its results very surprising. Indeed, the viewers who fail to see the gorilla are initially sure that it was not there—they cannot imagine missing such  a striking event. The gorilla study illustrates two important facts about our minds: we can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness. </p></div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> The interaction of the two systems is a recurrent theme of the book, and a brief synopsis of the plot is in order. In the story I will tell, Systems 1 and 2 are both active whenever we are awake. System 1 runs automatically  and System 2 is normally in a comfortable low-effort mode, in which only a fraction of its capacity is engaged. System 1 continuously generates suggestions for System 2: impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings. If endorsed by System 2, impressions and intuitions turn into beliefs, and impulses turn into voluntary actions. When all goes smoothly, which is most of the time, System 2 adopts  the suggestions of System 1 with little or no modification. You generally believe your impressions and act on your desires, and that is fine—usually. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 两个系统的互动是该书的一个反复出现的主题，简要介绍一下情节是有必要的。在我要讲的故事中，只要我们醒着，系统1和2都是活跃的。系统1自动运行  ，而系统2通常处于舒适的低能耗模式，其中只有一小部分能力被使用。系统1不断为系统2产生建议：印象、直觉、意图和感觉。如果得到系统2的认可，印象和直觉就会变成信念，冲动就会变成自愿的行动。当一切顺利时，也就是大多数时候，系统2会采纳系统1的建议，  ，几乎没有任何修改。你通常会相信你的印象，按照你的愿望行动，这很好，通常是这样。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> When System 1 runs into difficulty, it calls on System 2 to support more detailed and specific processing that may solve the problem of the moment. System 2 is mobilized when a question arises for which System 1 does not offer an answer, as probably  happened to you when you encountered the multiplication problem 17 × 24. You can also feel a surge of conscious attention whenever you are surprised. System 2 is activated when an event is detected that violates the model of the world that System 1 maintains. In that world, lamps do not jump, cats do not bark, and gorillas do not cross basketball courts. The gorilla experiment demonstrates that  some attention is needed for the surprising stimulus to be detected. Surprise then activates and orients your attention: you will stare, and you will search your memory for a story that makes sense of the surprising event. System 2 is also credited with the continuous monitoring of your own behavior—the control that keeps you polite when you are angry, and alert when you are driving at night.  System 2 is mobilized to increased effort when it detects an error about to be made. Remember a time when you almost blurted out an offensive remark and note how hard you worked to restore control. In summary, most of what you (your System 2) think and do originates in your System 1, but System 2 takes over when things get difficult, and it normally has the last word. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 当系统1遇到困难时，它会调用系统2来支持更详细、更具体的处理，以解决当前的问题。当出现系统1无法提供答案的问题时，系统2就会被调动起来，就像你遇到17×24的乘法问题时可能  。每当你感到惊讶时，你也能感觉到意识注意力的激增。 当检测到一个违反系统1所维护的世界模型的事件时，系统2被激活。 在那个世界里，灯不会跳，猫不会叫，大猩猩不会穿过篮球场。大猩猩的实验表明，  ，需要一定的注意力才能发现令人惊讶的刺激。然后，惊讶会激活并引导你的注意力：你会盯着看，你会在记忆中搜索一个能让人惊讶的事件有意义的故事。系统2也得益于对你自己行为的持续监控--当你生气时保持礼貌，当你在夜间驾驶时保持警惕的控制。 系统2在检测到即将发生的错误时，会被调动起来，加大努力。记住一次你差点说出冒犯性的话，注意你是如何努力恢复控制的。总之，你（你的系统2）的大部分想法和行为都源于你的系统1，但当事情变得困难时，系统2会接管，而且它通常有最后的决定权。 </p></div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> The division of labor between  System 1 and System 2 is highly efficient: it minimizes effort and optimizes performance. The arrangement works well most of the time because System 1 is generally very good at what it does: its models of familiar situations are accurate, its short-term predictions are usually accurate as well, and its initial reactions to challenges are swift and generally appropriate. System 1 has biases, however,  systematic errors that it is prone to make in specified circumstances. As we shall see, it sometimes answers easier questions than the one it was asked, and it has little understanding of logic and statistics. One further limitation of System 1 is that it cannot be turned off. If you are shown a word on the screen in a language you know, you will read it—unless your  attention is totally focused elsewhere . </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">  系统1和系统2之间的分工是非常有效的：它最大限度地减少了工作，优化了性能。这种安排在大多数情况下都很有效，因为系统1通常非常擅长它的工作：它对熟悉情况的模型是准确的，它的短期预测通常也是准确的，它对挑战的最初反应是迅速的，而且通常是适当的。然而，系统1有偏见，  ，它在特定情况下容易犯系统性错误。正如我们将看到的，它有时回答的问题比它被要求的问题更容易，而且它对逻辑和统计的理解很少。系统1的另一个限制是，它不能被关闭。如果你在屏幕上看到一个你知道的语言的单词，你就会读它--除非你的 注意力完全集中在其他地方  。 </p></div>

Where winters are hard, many drivers have memories of their car skidding out of control on the ice and of the struggle to follow well-rehearsed instructions that negate what they would naturally do: “Steer into the skid, and whatever you do, do not touch the brakes!” And every human being has had the experience  of  not  telling someone to go to hell.

<p class ="en"> Not all illusions are visual. There are illusions of thought, which we call  cognitive illusions . As a graduate student, I attended some courses on the art and science of psychotherapy. During one of these lectures, our teacher imparted a morsel of clinical wisdom. This is what he told us: “You will from time to time meet a patient who shares a disturbing  tale of multiple mistakes in his previous treatment. He has been seen by several clinicians, and all failed him. The patient can lucidly describe how his therapists misunderstood him, but he has quickly perceived that you are different. You share the same feeling, are convinced that you understand him, and will be  able to help.” At this point my teacher raised his voice as he said, “Do not even  think  of taking on this patient! Throw him out of the office! He is most likely a psychopath and you will not be able to help him.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Many years later I learned that the teacher had warned us against  psychopathic charm , and the leading authority in the study of psychopathy confirmed that the teacher’s advice was sound. The analogy to the Müller Lyer illusion is close. What we were being taught was  not how to feel about that patient. Our teacher took it for granted that the sympathy we would feel for the patient would not be under our control; it would arise from System 1. Furthermore, we were not being taught to be generally suspicious of our feelings about patients. We were told that a strong attraction to a patient with a repeated history of failed treatment is a danger sign—like the fins  on the parallel lines. It is an illusion—a cognitive illusion—and I (System 2) was taught how to recognize it and advised not to believe it or act on it. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The question that is most often asked about cognitive illusions is whether they can be overcome. The message of these examples is not encouraging. Because System 1 operates automatically and cannot be turned off at will, errors of intuitive  thought are often difficult to prevent. Biases cannot always be avoided, because System 2 may have no clue to the error. Even when cues to likely errors are available, errors can be prevented only by the enhanced monitoring and effortful activity of System 2. As a way to live your life, however, continuous vigilance is not necessarily good, and it is certainly impractical. Constantly questioning our  own thinking would be impossibly tedious, and System 2 is much too slow and inefficient to serve as a substitute for System 1 in making routine decisions. The best we can do is a compromise: learn to recognize situations in which mistakes are likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes when the stakes are high. The premise of this book is that it is easier to recognize other people’s mistakes  than our own. </p></div>

My answer is that the brief active sentence that attributes calculation to System 2 is intended as a description, not an explanation. It is meaningful only because of what you already know about System 2. It is shorthand for the following: “Mental arithmetic is a voluntary activity that requires effort, should not be performed while making a left turn, and is associated with dilated pupils  and an accelerated heart rate.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> System 1 and System 2 are so central to the story I tell in this book that I must make it absolutely clear that they are fictitious characters. Systems 1 and 2 are not systems in the standard sense of entities with interacting aspects or parts. And there  is no one part of the brain that either of the systems would call home. You may well ask: What is the point of introducing fictitious characters with ugly names into a serious book? The answer is that the characters are useful because of some quirks of our minds, yours and mine. A sentence is understood more easily if it describes what an agent (System 2) does than if it describes what something  is, what properties it has. In other words, “System 2” is a better subject for a sentence than “mental arithmetic.” The mind—especially System 1—appears to have a special aptitude for the construction and interpretation of stories about active agents, who have personalities, habits, and abilities. You quickly formed a bad opinion of the thieving butler, you expect more bad behavior from him, and  you will remember him for a while. This is also my hope for the language of systems. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> I have a long personal history with the Add-1 task. Early in my career I spent a year at the University of Michigan, as a visitor in a laboratory that studied hypnosis. Casting about for a useful topic of research, I found an article in  Scientific American  in which the psychologist Eckhard Hess described  the  pupil of the eye  as a window to the soul. I reread it recently and again found it inspiring. It begins with Hess reporting that his wife had noticed his pupils widening as he watched beautiful nature pictures, and it ends with two striking pictures of the same good-looking woman, who somehow appears much more attractive in one than in the other. There is only one difference: the pupils of  the eyes appear dilated in the attractive picture and constricted in the other. Hess also wrote of belladonna, a pupil-dilating substance that was used as a cosmetic, and of bazaar shoppers who wear dark glasses in order to hide their level of interest from merchants. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 我与Add-1任务有很长的个人历史。在我职业生涯的早期，我在密歇根大学呆了一年，作为一个研究催眠的实验室的访问者。 在寻找一个有用的研究课题时，我在《 科学美国人》 上发现了一篇文章，其中心理学家埃克哈德-赫斯将  ，将 眼睛的瞳孔 描述为通往灵魂的窗口。我最近重读了这本书，再次发现它很有启发。它的开头是赫斯报告说他的妻子注意到他在观看美丽的自然图片时瞳孔扩大了，它的结尾是两张引人注目的照片，都是同一个好看的女人，不知何故，她在其中一张中比另一张中显得更有吸引力。只有一个区别：  ，眼睛的瞳孔在有吸引力的图片中出现扩张，而在另一个图片中则是收缩的。赫斯还写到了颠茄，一种被用作化妆品的瞳孔扩张物质，以及在集市上购物的人戴着黑框眼镜，以掩盖他们对商人的兴趣程度。 </p></div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> One of Hess’s findings especially captured my attention. He had noticed that the pupils are sensitive indicators of mental effort—they  dilate substantially when people multiply two-digit numbers, and they dilate more if the problems are hard than if they are easy. His observations indicated that the response to mental effort is distinct from emotional arousal. Hess’s work did not have much to do with hypnosis, but I concluded that the idea of a visible indication of mental effort had promise as a research topic. A graduate  student in the lab, Jackson Beatty, shared my enthusiasm and we got to work. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 赫斯的一项发现尤其吸引了我的注意。 他注意到，瞳孔是衡量脑力劳动的敏感指标--当人们将两位数的数字相乘时，瞳孔  ，大幅放大，如果问题难，瞳孔放大的程度比容易的要大。他的观察表明，对心理努力的反应与情绪唤醒不同。赫斯的工作与催眠没有太大关系，但我得出结论，心理努力的可见指示这一想法有希望成为研究课题。实验室的一名研究生  ，Jackson Beatty，与我有同样的热情，我们开始了工作。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Beatty and I developed a setup similar to an optician’s examination room, in which the experimental participant leaned her head on a chin-and-forehead rest and stared at a camera while listening to prerecorded information and answering questions on the recorded beats of a metronome. The beats triggered an infrared flash  every second, causing a picture to be taken. At the end of each experimental session, we would rush to have the film developed, project the images of the pupil on a screen, and go to work with a ruler. The method was a perfect fit for young and impatient  researchers: we knew our results almost immediately, and they always told a clear story. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> Beatty和我开发了一个类似于验光室的装置，在这个装置中，实验参与者将头靠在一个下巴和前额的支架上，盯着一个摄像头，同时聆听预先录制的信息，并在节拍器的记录节拍上回答问题。节拍每秒钟都会触发红外闪光灯  ，导致照片被拍下。在每个实验环节结束时，我们会赶去冲洗胶片，将瞳孔的图像投射到屏幕上，然后拿着尺子去工作。这种方法非常适合年轻而缺乏耐心的 研究人员：我们几乎马上就能知道我们的结果，而且它们总是讲述一个清晰的故事。 </p></div>

<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Beatty and I focused on paced tasks, such as Add-1,  in which we knew precisely what was  on the subject’s mind  at any time. We recorded strings of digits on beats of the metronome and instructed the subject to repeat or transform the digits one by one, maintaining the same rhythm. We soon discovered that the size of the pupil varied second by second, reflecting the changing demands of the task. The shape of the response was an inverted V. As you  experienced it if you tried Add-1 or Add-3, effort builds up with every added digit that you hear, reaches an almost intolerable peak as you rush to produce a transformed string during and immediately after the pause, and relaxes gradually as you “unload” your short-term memory. The pupil data corresponded precisely to subjective experience: longer strings reliably caused larger dilations, the transformation  task compounded the effort, and the peak of pupil size coincided with maximum effort. Add-1 with four digits caused a larger dilation than the task of holding seven digits for immediate recall. Add-3, which is much more difficult, is the most demanding that I ever observed. In the first 5 seconds, the pupil dilates by about 50% of its original area and  heart rate increases  by about 7 beats per  minute. This is as hard as people can work—they give up if more is asked of them. When we exposed our subjects to more digits than they could remember, their pupils stopped dilating or actually shrank. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> Beatty和我专注于有节奏的任务，如Add-1，  ，在这些任务中，我们准确地知道 受试者 在任何时候都在 想 什么。我们在节拍器的节拍上记录数字串，并指示受试者一个一个地重复或转换数字，保持相同的节奏。 我们很快发现，瞳孔的大小每秒都在变化，反映了任务的需求变化。  反应的形状是一个倒V形。如果你试过加法-1或加法-3，你会发现，每听到一个加法数字，你的努力就会增加，在暂停期间和紧接着的时间里，你急于产生一个转换的字符串，达到一个几乎无法忍受的高峰，而当你 "卸下 "你的短期记忆时，就会逐渐放松。瞳孔数据与主观体验完全吻合：较长的琴弦可靠地引起较大的扩张，转换  任务加重了努力，而瞳孔大小的峰值与最大努力相吻合。四个数字的加法-1比持有七个数字的任务引起更大的扩张，以便立即回忆。加三，难度更大，是我所观察到的要求最高的。在最初的5秒钟内，瞳孔扩大了约50%的原始面积， 心率增加了 约7次/  分钟。当我们让受试者接触到比他们能够记住的更多的数字时，他们的瞳孔就会停止扩张或实际上缩小。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> We worked for some months in a spacious basement suite in which we had set up a closed-circuit system that projected an image of the subject’s pupil on a screen in the corridor; we also could hear  what was happening in the laboratory. The diameter of the projected pupil was about a foot; watching it dilate and contract when the participant was at work was a fascinating sight, quite an attraction for visitors in our lab. We amused ourselves and impressed our guests by our ability to divine when the participant gave up on a task. During a mental multiplication, the pupil normally dilated  to a large size within a few seconds and stayed large as long as the individual kept working on the problem; it contracted immediately when she found a solution or gave up. As we watched from the corridor, we would sometimes surprise both the owner of the pupil and our guests by asking, “Why did you stop working just now?” The answer from inside the lab was often, “How did you know?” to which we would  reply, “We have a window to your soul.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The casual observations we made from the corridor were sometimes as informative as the formal experiments. I made a significant discovery as I  was idly watching a woman’s pupil during a break between two tasks. She had kept her position on the chin rest, so I could see the image of her eye while she engaged in routine conversation with the experimenter.  I was surprised to see that the pupil remained small and did not noticeably dilate as she talked and listened. Unlike the tasks that we were studying, the mundane conversation apparently demanded little or no effort—no more than retaining two or three digits. This was a eureka moment: I realized that the tasks we had chosen for study were exceptionally effortful. An image came to mind: mental life—today  I would speak of the life of System 2—is normally conducted at the pace of a comfortable walk, sometimes interrupted by episodes of jogging and on rare occasions by a frantic sprint. The Add-1 and Add-3 exercises are sprints, and casual chatting is a stroll. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> We found that people, when engaged in a mental sprint, may become effectively blind. The authors of  The Invisible Gorilla  had made the gorilla  “invisible” by keeping the observers intensely busy counting passes. We reported a rather less dramatic example of blindness during Add-1. Our subjects were exposed to a series of  rapidly flashing letters  while they worked. They were told to give the task complete priority, but they were also asked to report, at the end of the digit task, whether the letter  K  had appeared at any time during the  trial. The main finding was that the ability to detect and report the target letter changed in the course of the 10 seconds of the exercise. The observers almost never missed a  K  that was shown at the beginning or near the end of the Add-1 task but they missed the target almost half the time when mental effort was at its peak, although we had pictures of their wide-open eye staring straight at  it. Failures of detection followed the same inverted-V pattern as the dilating pupil. The similarity was reassuring: the pupil was a good measure of the physical arousal that accompanies mental effort, and we could go ahead and use it to understand how the mind works. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Much like the electricity meter  outside your house or apartment, the pupils offer an index of the current rate at which mental  energy is used. The analogy goes deep. Your use of electricity depends on what you choose to do, whether to light a room or toast a piece of bread. When you turn on a bulb or a toaster, it draws the energy it needs but no more. Similarly, we decide what to do, but we have limited control over the effort of doing it. Suppose you are shown four digits, say, 9462, and told that your life depends on  holding them in memory for 10 seconds. However much you want to live, you cannot exert as much effort in this task as you would be forced to invest to complete an Add-3 transformation on the same digits. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> System  2 and the electrical circuits in your home both have limited capacity, but they respond differently to threatened overload. A breaker trips when the demand for current is excessive, causing  all devices on that circuit to lose power at once. In contrast, the response to mental overload is selective and precise: System 2 protects the most important activity, so it receives the attention it needs; “spare capacity” is allocated second by second to other tasks. In our version of the gorilla experiment, we instructed the participants to assign priority to the digit task. We know that  they followed that instruction, because the timing of the visual target had no effect on the main task. If the critical letter was presented at a time of high demand, the subjects simply did not see it. When the transformation task was less demanding, detection performance was better. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The tasks that we studied varied considerably in their effects on the pupil. At baseline, our subjects were awake, aware, and ready to engage in a  task—probably at a higher level of arousal and cognitive readiness than usual. Holding one or two digits in memory or learning to associate a word with  a digit (3 = door) produced reliable effects on momentary arousal above that baseline, but the effects were minuscule, only 5% of the increase in pupil diameter associated with Add-3. A task that required discriminating between the pitch of two tones yielded significantly larger dilations. Recent research has shown that inhibiting the tendency to  read distracting words  (as in  figure 2  of the preceding  chapter) also induces moderate effort. Tests of short-term memory for six or seven digits were more effortful. As you can experience, the request to retrieve and say aloud your phone number or your spouse’s birthday also requires a brief but significant effort, because the entire string must be held in memory as a response is organized. Mental multiplication of two-digit numbers and the Add-3  task are near the limit of what most people can do. </p></div>

System 2 is the only one that can follow rules, compare objects on several attributes, and make deliberate choices between options. The  automatic System 1 does not have these capabilities. System 1 detects simple relations (“they are all alike,” “the son is much taller than the father”) and excels at integrating information about one thing, but it does not deal with multiple distinct topics at once, nor is it adept at using purely statistical information. System 1 will detect that a person described as “a meek and tidy soul, with  a need for order and structure, and a passion for detail” resembles a caricature librarian, but combining this intuition with knowledge about the small number of librarians is a task that only System 2 can perform—if System 2 knows how to do so, which is true of few people. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> A crucial capability of System 2 is the adoption of “task sets”: it can program memory to obey an instruction that overrides  habitual responses. Consider the following: Count all occurrences of the letter  f  in this page. This is not a task you have ever performed before and it will not come naturally to you, but your System 2 can take it on. It will be effortful to set  yourself up for this exercise, and effortful to carry it out, though you will surely improve with practice. Psychologists speak of “executive control”  to describe the adoption and termination of task sets, and neuroscientists have identified the main regions of the brain that serve the executive function. One of these regions is involved whenever a conflict must be resolved. Another is the prefrontal area of the brain, a region that is substantially more developed in humans than in other primates, and is involved in operations that we  associate with intelligence . </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 系统2的一个重要能力是采用 "任务集"：它可以对内存进行编程，使其服从一个指令，而这个指令会推翻  的习惯性反应。考虑以下情况：计算这一页中所有字母 f 的出现次数。这不是你以前执行过的任务，对你来说也不会很自然，但你的系统2可以承担这个任务。为这一练习设置 ，并努力执行，尽管你一定会在实践中得到改善，但会很费力。心理学家谈到 "执行控制 "  ，以描述任务集的采用和终止，神经科学家已经确定了大脑中服务于执行功能的主要区域。其中一个区域在必须解决冲突时就会参与。另一个是大脑的前额区，这个区域在人类中的发育程度大大高于其他灵长类动物，它参与了我们 与智能有关的 操作  。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Now suppose that at the end of the page you get another instruction: count all the commas in the next page. This will be harder, because you will have to overcome the newly acquired tendency to focus attention on the letter  f . One of the significant discoveries of cognitive psychologists in recent decades is that switching from one task to another is effortful, especially  under time pressure . The need for rapid switching is one of the reasons that Add-3 and mental multiplication are so difficult. To perform the Add-3 task, you must hold several digits in your  working memory  at the same time, associating each with a particular operation: some digits are in the queue to be transformed, one is in the process of transformation, and others, already transformed, are retained for reporting.  Modern tests of working memory require the individual to switch repeatedly between two demanding tasks, retaining the results of one operation while performing the other. People who do well on these tests tend to do well on  tests of general intelligence . However, the ability to control attention is not simply a measure of intelligence; measures of efficiency in the control of attention predict  performance of air traffic controllers and of  Israeli Air Force pilots  beyond the effects of intelligence. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 现在假设在这一页的最后，你得到了另一个指令：计算下一页中所有的逗号。近几十年来，认知心理学家的一个重要发现是，从一个任务切换到另一个任务是很费力的，尤其是 在时间紧迫的情况下  。对快速切换的需求是加3和心算乘法如此困难的原因之一。为了执行Add-3任务，你必须在你的 工作记忆 中同时保留几个数字，将每个数字与一个特定的操作联系起来：一些数字在队列中被转化，一个数字正在转化过程中，而其他已经转化的数字则被保留下来用于报告。  现代的工作记忆测试要求个人在两个高要求的任务之间反复切换，在执行另一个任务时保留一个操作的结果。在这些测试中表现良好的人往往在 一般智力测试 中表现良好。然而，控制注意力的能力并不仅仅是衡量智力的标准；控制注意力的效率的措施可以预测空中交通管制员和 以色列空军飞行员 的表现  ，超越智力的影响。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Time pressure is another driver of effort. As you carried out the Add-3 exercise, the rush was imposed in part by the metronome and in part by the load on memory. Like a juggler with several balls in the air, you cannot afford to slow down; the rate at which material decays in memory forces  the pace, driving you to refresh and rehearse information before it is lost. Any task that requires you to keep several ideas in mind at the same time has the same hurried character. Unless you have the good fortune of a capacious working memory, you may be forced to work uncomfortably hard. The most effortful forms of slow thinking are those that require you to think fast. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 时间压力是另一个努力的驱动因素。当你进行Add-3练习时，急促的节奏部分是由节拍器造成的，部分是由记忆的负荷造成的。就像一个在空中玩杂耍的人，你不能慢下来；材料在记忆中衰减的速度迫使  ，促使你在信息丢失之前进行刷新和排练。任何需要你在同一时间保持几个想法的任务都具有同样的匆忙特点。除非你幸运地拥有大容量的工作记忆，否则你可能被迫不自觉地努力工作。最努力的慢速思考形式是那些需要你快速思考的形式。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> You surely observed  as you performed Add-3 how unusual it is for your mind to work so hard. Even if you think for a living, few of the mental tasks in which you engage in the course of a working day are as demanding as  Add-3, or even as demanding as storing six digits for immediate recall. We normally avoid mental overload by dividing our tasks into multiple easy steps, committing intermediate results to long-term  memory or to paper rather than to an easily overloaded working memory. We cover long distances by taking our time and conduct our mental lives by the law of least effort. </p></div>

I certainly exert physical effort and burn more calories at that speed than if I sat in a recliner, but I experience no strain, no conflict, and no need to push myself.

He will almost certainly stop  in his tracks. My experience is that I can think while strolling but cannot engage in mental work that imposes a heavy load on short-term memory.

My ability to bring a train of thought to a conclusion is impaired accordingly. At the highest speed I can sustain on the hills, about 14 minutes for a mile, I do  not even try to think of anything else.

This is how the law of least effort comes to be a law. Even in the absence of time pressure, maintaining a coherent train of thought requires discipline.

<p class ="en"> Fortunately, cognitive work is not always aversive, and people sometimes expend considerable effort for long periods of time without having to exert willpower. The  psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (pronounced six-cent-mihaly) has done more than anyone else to study this state of effortless attending, and the name he proposed for it,  flow , has become part of the language. People who experience flow describe it as “a state of effortless concentration so deep that they lose their sense of time, of themselves, of their problems,” and their descriptions of  the joy of that state are so compelling that Csikszentmihalyi has called it an  “optimal experience.”  Many activities can induce a sense of flow, from painting to racing motorcycles—and for some fortunate authors I know, even writing a book is often an optimal  experience. Flow neatly separates the two forms of effort: concentration on the task and the deliberate control of attention. Riding a motorcycle  at 150 miles an hour and playing a competitive game of chess are certainly very effortful. In a state of flow, however, maintaining focused attention on these absorbing activities requires no exertion of self-control, thereby freeing resources to be directed to the task at hand. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> It is now a well-established proposition that both self-control and cognitive effort  are forms of mental work. Several psychological studies have shown that people who are simultaneously challenged by a demanding cognitive task and by a temptation are more likely to yield to the temptation. Imagine that you are asked to retain a list of seven digits for a minute or two. You are told that remembering the digits is your top priority. While your attention is focused on the digits, you  are offered a choice between two desserts: a sinful chocolate cake and a virtuous fruit salad. The evidence suggests that you would be more likely to select the tempting chocolate cake when your mind is loaded with digits. System 1 has more influence on behavior when System 2 is busy, and it has a  sweet tooth . </p></div>

Memorizing and repeating digits loosens the hold of System 2 on behavior, but of course cognitive load is not the only cause of weakened self-control. A few drinks have the same effect, as does a sleepless night. The self-control of morning people is impaired at night; the reverse is true of night people. Too much concern about how  well one is doing in a task sometimes disrupts performance by loading short-term memory with  pointless anxious thoughts . The conclusion is straightforward: self-control requires attention and effort. Another way of saying this is that controlling thoughts and behaviors is one of the tasks that System 2 performs. </p></div>

In a typical demonstration, participants who are instructed to stifle their emotional reaction to an emotionally charged film will later perform poorly on a test of physical stamina—how long they can maintain a strong grip on a dynamometer in spite of increasing discomfort. The emotional effort  in the first phase of the experiment reduces the ability to withstand the pain of sustained muscle contraction, and ego-depleted people therefore succumb more quickly to the urge to quit.

<p class ="en"> The evidence is persuasive: activities that impose high demands on System 2 require self-control, and the  exertion of self-control  is depleting and unpleasant. Unlike cognitive load, ego depletion is at least in part a loss of motivation. After exerting self-control in one task, you do not feel like making an effort in another, although you could do it if you really had to. In several  experiments, people were able to  resist the effects of ego depletion  when given a strong incentive to do so. In contrast, increasing effort is not an option when you must keep six digits in short-term memory while performing  a task. Ego depletion is not the same mental state as cognitive busyness. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 证据是有说服力的：对系统2提出高要求的活动需要自我控制，而 自我控制的发挥 是消耗性的，令人不快的。与认知负荷不同，自我耗损至少在某种程度上是一种动机的丧失。 在一项任务中发挥了自我控制能力后，你不觉得在另一项任务中作出努力，尽管如果你真的不得不这样做，你也可以这样做。在几个  实验中，当被给予强烈的激励时，人们能够 抵制自我耗损的影响 。相比之下，当你在执行 一项任务时，必须在短期记忆中保持六位数，增加努力是不可能的。自我耗损与认知忙碌的精神状态不同。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The most surprising discovery made by Baumeister’s group shows, as he puts it, that the idea of  mental energy is  more than a mere metaphor . The nervous system consumes more glucose than most other parts of the body, and effortful mental activity appears to be especially expensive in the currency of glucose. When you are actively involved in difficult cognitive reasoning or engaged in a task that requires self-control, your blood glucose level drops. The effect is analogous to a runner who  draws down glucose stored in her muscles during a sprint. The bold implication of this idea is that the effects of  ego depletion  could be undone by ingesting glucose, and Baumeister and his colleagues have confirmed this hypothesis in several experiments. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Volunteers in one of their studies watched a short silent film of a woman being interviewed and were asked to interpret her body language.  While they were performing the task, a series of words crossed the screen in slow succession. The participants were specifically instructed to ignore the words, and if they found their attention drawn away they had to refocus their concentration on the woman’s behavior. This act of self-control was known to cause ego depletion. All the volunteers drank some lemonade before participating in a second  task. The lemonade was sweetened with glucose for half of them and with Splenda for the others. Then all participants were given a task in which they needed to overcome an intuitive response to get the correct answer. Intuitive errors are normally much more frequent among ego-depleted people, and the drinkers of Splenda showed the expected depletion effect. On the other hand, the glucose drinkers  were not depleted. Restoring the level of available sugar in the brain had prevented the deterioration of performance. It will take some time and much further research to establish whether the tasks that cause glucose-depletion also cause the momentary arousal that is reflected in increases of pupil size and heart rate. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> A disturbing demonstration of  depletion effects in judgment  was recently  reported in the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . The unwitting participants in the study were eight parole judges in Israel. They spend entire days reviewing applications for parole. The cases are presented in random order, and the judges spend little time on each one, an average of 6 minutes. (The default decision is denial of parole; only 35% of requests are approved. The exact  time of each decision is recorded, and the times of the judges’ three food breaks—morning break, lunch, and afternoon break—during the day are recorded as well.) The authors of the study plotted the  proportion of approved requests against the time since the last food break. The proportion spikes after each meal, when about 65% of requests are granted. During the two hours or so until the judges’  next feeding, the approval rate drops steadily, to about zero just before the meal. As you might expect, this is an unwelcome result and the authors carefully checked many alternative explanations. The best possible account of the data provides bad news: tired and hungry judges tend to fall back on the easier default position of denying requests for parole. Both fatigue and hunger probably play  a role. </p></div>

His reasoning was that we know a significant fact  about anyone who says that the ball costs 10¢: that person did not actively check whether the answer was correct, and her System 2 endorsed an intuitive answer that it could have rejected with a small investment of effort. Furthermore, we also know that the people who give the intuitive answer have missed an obvious social cue; they should have wondered why anyone would include in a questionnaire  a puzzle with such an obvious answer. A failure to check is remarkable  because the cost of checking is so low: a few seconds of mental work (the problem is moderately difficult), with slightly tensed muscles and dilated pupils, could avoid an embarrassing mistake. People who say 10¢ appear to be ardent followers of the law of least effort. People who avoid that answer appear to have more active  minds. </p></div>

The “trick” is whether the respondent will remember that  Detroit, a high-crime city,  is in Michigan. College students in the United States know this fact and will correctly identify Detroit as the largest city in Michigan. But knowledge of a fact is not all-or-none. Facts that we know do not always come to mind when we need them. People who remember that Detroit is in Michigan give higher estimates of the murder rate in the state than people who do not, but a majority of Frederick’s  respondents did not think of the city when questioned about the state.

<p class ="en"> Blame for a failure to think of Detroit can be laid on both System 1 and System 2. Whether the city comes to mind when the state is mentioned depends in part on the  automatic function of memory. People differ in this respect. The representation of the state of Michigan is very detailed in some people’s minds: residents of the state are more likely to retrieve many facts about it than people who live elsewhere; geography buffs will retrieve more than others who specialize in baseball statistics; more intelligent individuals are more likely than others to have  rich representations of most things. Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed. Memory function is an attribute of System 1. However, everyone has the option of slowing down to conduct an active search of memory for all possibly relevant facts—just as they could slow down to check the intuitive answer  in the bat-and-ball problem. The extent of deliberate checking and search is a characteristic of System 2, which varies among individuals. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Shane Frederick constructed a Cognitive Reflection Test, which consists of the bat-and-ball  problem and two other questions, chosen because they also invite an intuitive answer that is both compelling and wrong (the questions are shown in  chapter 5 ). He went on to study the characteristics of students who score very low on this test—the supervisory function of System 2 is weak in these people—and found that they are prone to answer questions with the first idea that comes to mind and  unwilling to invest the effort needed to check their intuitions. Individuals who uncritically follow their intuitions about puzzles are also prone to accept other suggestions from System 1. In particular, they are impulsive, impatient, and keen to receive immediate gratification. For example, 63% of the intuitive respondents say they would prefer to get $3,400 this month rather than $3,800 next month.  Only 37% of those who solve all three puzzles correctly have the same shortsighted preference for receiving a smaller amount immediately. When asked how much they will pay to get overnight delivery of a book they have ordered, the low scorers on the Cognitive Reflection Test are willing to pay twice as much as the high scorers. Frederick’s findings suggest that the characters of our psychodrama  have different “personalities.” System 1 is impulsive and intuitive; System 2 is capable of reasoning, and it is cautious, but at least for some people it is also lazy. We recognize related differences among individuals: some people are more like their System 2; others are closer to their System 1. This simple test has emerged as one of the better predictors of lazy thinking. </p></div>

Stanovich and his colleagues have spent decades studying differences among individuals in the kinds of problems with which this book is concerned. They have asked one basic question in many different ways: What makes some people more susceptible  than others to biases of judgment? Stanovich published his conclusions in a book titled  Rationality and the Reflective Mind , which offers a bold and distinctive approach to the topic of this chapter. He draws a sharp distinction between two parts of System 2—indeed, the distinction is so sharp that he calls them  separate “minds.” One of these minds (he calls it algorithmic) deals with slow thinking  and demanding computation. Some people are better than others in these tasks of brain power—they are the individuals who excel in intelligence tests and are able to switch from one task to another quickly and efficiently. However, Stanovich argues that high intelligence does not make people immune to biases. Another ability is involved, which he labels rationality. Stanovich’s concept of a rational  person is similar to what I earlier labeled “engaged.” The core of his argument is that  rationality  should be distinguished from  intelligence . In his view, superficial or “lazy” thinking is a flaw in the reflective mind, a failure of rationality. This is an attractive and thought-provoking idea. In support of it, Stanovich and his colleagues have found that the bat-and-ball question and others  like it are somewhat better indicators of our susceptibility to cognitive errors than are  conventional measures of intelligence , such as IQ tests. Time will tell whether the distinction between intelligence and rationality can lead to new discoveries. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> Keith Stanovich  和他的长期合作者Richard West最初提出了系统1和系统2这两个术语（他们现在更喜欢说类型1和类型2的过程）。Stanovich和他的同事花了几十年时间研究个人在本书所关注的各种问题上的差异。他们以许多不同的方式提出一个基本问题：是什么让一些人比其他人更容易受到判断偏差的影响  ？斯坦诺维奇在一本名为《 理性与反思的心灵 》的书中发表了他的结论，这本书为本章的主题提供了一个大胆而独特的方法。他在系统2的两个部分之间做出了鲜明的区分--事实上，这种区分是如此鲜明，以至于他把它们称为 "思想"。其中一种思维（他称之为算法）处理缓慢的思维  ，并要求计算。有些人在这些脑力任务方面比其他人强--他们是在智力测试中表现出色的人，能够快速有效地从一个任务切换到另一个任务。 然而，斯坦诺维奇认为，高智力并不能使人们免于偏见。还涉及另一种能力，他称之为理性。 斯坦诺维奇关于理性  的概念类似于我早先标注的 "参与"。他的论点的核心是，应将 理性 与 智力 区分开来。在他看来，肤浅或 "懒惰 "的思维是反思性思维的缺陷，是理性的失败。 这是一个有吸引力和发人深省的想法。为了支持它，斯坦诺维奇和他的同事们发现，球棒和球的问题以及其他  ，与 传统的智力测量方法 （如智商测试）相比，在某种程度上更能说明我们对认知错误的易感性。 时间将证明智力和理性之间的区别是否能带来新的发现。 </p></div>

The facial expression and the avoidance motion intensify the feelings to which they are linked, and the feelings in turn reinforce compatible ideas.

<p class ="en"> The mechanism that causes these mental events has been known for a long time: it is the association of ideas. We all understand from  experience that ideas follow each other in our conscious mind in a fairly orderly way. The British philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries searched for the rules that explain such sequences. In  An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding , published in 1748, the Scottish philosopher  David Hume reduced the principles of association to three: resemblance, contiguity in time and place,  and causality. Our concept of association has changed radically since Hume’s days, but his three principles still provide a good start. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> I will adopt an expansive view of what an idea is. It can be concrete or abstract, and it can be expressed in many ways: as a verb, as a noun, as an adjective, or as a clenched fist. Psychologists think of ideas as nodes in a vast network, called associative  memory, in which each idea is linked to many others. There are different types of links: causes are linked to their effects (virus  ➞  cold); things to their properties (lime  ➞  green); things to the categories to which they belong (banana  ➞  fruit). One way we have advanced beyond Hume is that we no longer think of the mind as going through a sequence of conscious ideas, one at a time. In the current  view of how associative memory works, a great deal happens at once. An idea that has been activated does not merely evoke one other idea. It activates many ideas, which in turn activate others. Furthermore, only a few of the activated ideas will register in consciousness; most of the work of associative thinking is silent, hidden from our conscious selves. The notion that we have limited access  to the workings of our minds is difficult to accept because, naturally, it is alien to our experience, but it is true: you know far less about yourself than you feel you do. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 我将采用一种广义的观点来理解什么是理念。 它可以是具体的，也可以是抽象的，它可以用多种方式来表达：作为动词，作为名词，作为形容词，或者作为一个紧握的拳头。心理学家认为想法是一个庞大网络中的节点，称为联想  ，其中每个想法都与许多其他想法相联系。有不同类型的联系：原因与它们的效果相联系（病毒➞感冒）；事物与它们的属性相联系（青柠➞绿色）；事物与它们所属的类别相联系（香蕉➞水果）。 我们超越休谟的一个方法是，我们不再认为头脑是一次一次地经历一系列有意识的想法。在目前关于联想记忆如何工作的  ，大量的事情都是一次发生。一个被激活的想法不只是唤起一个其他的想法。此外，只有少数被激活的想法会在意识中记录下来；联想思维的大部分工作是沉默的，被我们有意识的自我隐藏起来。我们对自己的思维运作的访问有限，  ，这一概念很难接受，因为它自然与我们的经验格格不入，但这是事实：你对自己的了解远比你觉得的要少。 </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 引导的奇妙之处 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> As is common in science, the first big breakthrough in our understanding of the mechanism of association was an improvement in a method of measurement. Until a few decades ago, the only way to study  associations was to ask many people questions such as, “What is the first word that comes to your mind when you hear the word DAY?” The researchers tallied the frequency of responses, such as “night,” “sunny,” or “long.” In the 1980s, psychologists discovered that exposure to a word causes immediate and measurable changes in the ease with which many related words can be evoked. If you have recently  seen or heard the word EAT, you are temporarily more likely to complete the word fragment SO_P as SOUP than as SOAP. The opposite would happen, of course, if you had just seen WASH. We call this a  priming effect  and say that the idea of EAT primes the idea of SOUP, and that  WASH primes SOAP . </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 正如科学中常见的那样，我们对联想机制的理解的第一个重大突破是对一种测量方法的改进。直到几十年前，研究  联想的唯一方法是问许多人问题，如："当你听到DAY这个词时，你脑子里想到的第一个词是什么？"研究人员统计了回答的频率，如 "晚上"、"晴天 "或 "长"。在20世纪80年代，心理学家发现，接触一个词会使许多相关的词被唤起的难易程度立即发生可测量的变化。 如果你最近  ，看到或听到EAT这个词，你暂时更有可能把SO_P这个词片断完成为SOUP而不是SOAP。当然，如果你刚刚看到了 "洗"，情况就会相反。 我们把这称为 引爆效应 ，并说 "吃 "的概念引爆了 "汤 "的概念，而 "洗 "引爆了 "肥皂"。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Priming effects take many forms. If the idea of EAT is currently on your mind (whether or not you are  conscious of it), you will be quicker than  usual to recognize the word SOUP when it is spoken in a whisper or presented in a blurry font. And of course you are primed not only for the idea of soup but also for a multitude of food-related ideas, including fork, hungry, fat, diet, and cookie. If for your most recent meal you sat at a wobbly restaurant table, you will be primed for wobbly as well.  Furthermore, the primed ideas have some ability to prime other ideas, although more weakly. Like ripples on a pond, activation spreads through a small part of the vast network of associated ideas. The mapping of these ripples is now one of the most exciting pursuits in psychological research. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">  引发效应有多种形式。 如果 "吃 "的概念目前在你的脑海中（无论你是否有意识到这一点），当SOUP这个词被低声说出来或以模糊的字体呈现时，你会比 通常更快地识别它。当然，你不仅对汤的想法有了初步认识，而且对众多与食物有关的想法也有了认识，包括叉子、饥饿、脂肪、饮食和饼干。如果你最近的一餐是坐在摇摇晃晃的餐厅桌子上，那么你也会有摇摇晃晃的心理准备。  此外，被激发的想法也有一定的能力来激发其他想法，尽管比较弱。就像池塘上的涟漪一样，激活通过庞大的相关思想网络中的一小部分传播开来。 绘制这些涟漪的地图现在是心理学研究中最令人兴奋的追求之一。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Another major advance in our understanding of memory was the discovery that priming is not restricted  to concepts and words. You cannot know this from conscious experience, of course, but you must accept the alien idea that your actions and your emotions can be primed by events of which you are not even aware. In an experiment that became an instant classic, the psychologist John Bargh and his collaborators asked students at New York University—most aged eighteen to twenty-two—to assemble four-word  sentences from a set of five words (for example,  “finds he it yellow instantly” ). For one group of students, half the scrambled sentences contained words associated with the elderly, such as  Florida ,  forgetful ,  bald ,  gray , or  wrinkle . When they had completed that task, the young participants were sent out to do another experiment in an office down the hall. That short walk was what the experiment  was about. The researchers unobtrusively measured the time it took people to get from one end of the corridor to the other. As Bargh had predicted, the young people who had fashioned a sentence from words with an elderly theme walked down the hallway significantly more slowly than the others. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 我们对记忆的理解的另一个重大进展是发现引力并不局限于  到概念和单词。当然，你不能从有意识的经验中知道这一点，但你必须接受一个陌生的想法，即你的行动和你的情绪可以被你甚至没有意识到的事件所激发。在一个立即成为经典的实验中，心理学家约翰-巴格和他的合作者要求纽约大学的学生--大多数年龄在18到22岁之间--从一组五个词（例如， "发现他它立刻变黄了"） 中组合出四个词的  。对于一组学生来说，一半的争抢句子包含与老年人有关的词，例如 佛罗里达 、 健忘 、 秃头 、 灰色 或 皱纹 。当他们完成这项任务后，年轻的参与者被派到走廊尽头的办公室里做另一个实验。这段短暂的步行就是实验  。研究人员不露声色地测量了人们从走廊的一端到另一端所需的时间。正如巴格所预料的那样，那些以老年人为主题的话语组成句子的年轻人在走廊上走得明显比其他人慢。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The “Florida effect” involves two stages of priming. First, the set of words primes thoughts of old age,  though the word  old  is never mentioned; second, these thoughts prime a behavior, walking slowly, which is associated with old age. All this happens without any awareness. When they were questioned afterward, none of the students reported noticing that the words had had a common theme, and they all insisted that nothing they did after the first experiment could have been influenced by the words  they had encountered. The idea of old age had not come to their conscious awareness, but their actions had changed nevertheless. This remarkable priming phenomenon—the influencing of an action by the idea—is known as the ideomotor effect. Although you surely were not aware of it, reading this paragraph primed you as well. If you had needed to stand up to get a glass of water, you would have been  slightly slower than usual to rise from your  chair—unless you happen to dislike the elderly, in which case research suggests that you might have been slightly faster than usual! </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 佛罗里达效应 "包括两个阶段的激发。首先，这组词激发了对老年的想法，  ，尽管从未提到过 老 这个词；其次，这些想法激发了一种行为，即缓慢行走，这与老年有关。当他们事后被询问时，没有一个学生报告说注意到这些词有一个共同的主题，而且他们都坚持认为他们在第一次实验后所做的任何事情都不可能受到他们所遇到的词  。老年的想法并没有出现在他们的意识中，但他们的行动还是发生了变化。这种显著的激发现象--思想对行动的影响--被称为思想运动效应。 尽管你肯定没有意识到这一点，但读了这段话后，你也被激发了。  如果你需要站起来拿一杯水，你从 椅子上站起来的速度会比平时稍慢--除非你碰巧不喜欢老年人，在这种情况下，研究表明你可能会比平时稍快一些。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The ideomotor link also works in reverse. A study conducted in a German university was the mirror image of the early experiment that Bargh and his colleagues had carried out in New York. Students were asked to walk around  a room for 5 minutes at a rate of 30 steps per minute, which was about one-third their normal pace. After this brief experience, the participants were much quicker to recognize  words related to old age , such as  forgetful ,  old , and  lonely . Reciprocal priming effects tend to produce a coherent reaction: if you were primed to think of old age, you would tend to act old, and acting old would reinforce  the thought of old age. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 意念运动的联系也是反向工作的。在德国一所大学进行的一项研究是巴格和他的同事在纽约进行的早期实验的镜像。学生们被要求以每分钟30步的速度在  一个房间里走5分钟，这大约是他们正常步伐的三分之一。在这种短暂的体验之后，参与者更快地认出了 与老年有关的词语 ，如 健忘 、 年老 和 孤独 。 相互引诱效应往往会产生一种连贯的反应：如果你被引诱想到老年，你就会倾向于表现出老年，而表现出老年会加强  对老年的思考。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Reciprocal links are common in the associative network. For example, being amused tends to make you smile, and smiling tends to make you feel amused. Go ahead and take a pencil, and hold it between your teeth for a few seconds with the eraser pointing to your right and the point to your left. Now hold the pencil so the point is aimed straight in front of you, by pursing  your lips around the eraser end. You were probably unaware that one of these actions forced your face into a frown and the other into a smile. College students were asked to rate the humor of cartoons from Gary Larson’s  The Far Side  while holding a pencil in their mouth. Those who were “smiling” (without any awareness of doing so) found the cartoons funnier than did those who were “frowning.”  In another experiment, people whose face was shaped into a frown (by squeezing their eyebrows together) reported an enhanced emotional response to  upsetting pictures —starving children, people arguing, maimed accident victims. </p></div>

They were told that the purpose of the experiment was to test the quality of the audio equipment and were instructed to move their heads repeatedly to check for any distortions of sound. Half the participants were told to nod their head up and down while others were told to shake it side to side. The messages they heard were radio editorials. Those who nodded (a yes gesture) tended to accept the  message they heard, but those who shook their head tended to reject it. Again, there was no awareness, just a habitual connection between an attitude of rejection or acceptance and its common physical expression. You can see why the common admonition to “act calm and kind regardless of how you feel” is very good advice: you are likely to be rewarded by actually feeling calm and kind. </p></div>

Our vote should not be affected by the location of the polling station, for example,  but it is. A study of voting patterns in precincts of Arizona in 2000 showed that the support for propositions to  increase the funding of schools  was significantly greater when the polling station was in a school than when it was in a nearby location. A separate experiment showed that exposing people to images of classrooms and school lockers also increased the tendency of participants to support  a school initiative. The effect of the images was larger than the difference between parents and other voters!

They persevered almost twice as long in trying to solve a very difficult problem before they asked the experimenter for help, a crisp demonstration of increased self-reliance. Money-primed people are also more selfish: they were much less willing to spend time helping another student  who pretended to be confused about an experimental task. When an experimenter clumsily dropped a bunch of pencils on the floor, the participants with money (unconsciously) on their mind picked up fewer pencils. In another experiment in the series, participants were told that they would shortly have a get-acquainted conversation with another person and were asked to set up two chairs while the  experimenter left to retrieve that person. Participants primed by money chose to stay much farther apart than their nonprimed peers (118 vs. 80 centimeters). Money-primed undergraduates also showed a greater preference for being alone. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The general theme of these findings is that the idea of money primes  individualism: a reluctance to be involved with others, to depend on others, or to accept  demands from others. The psychologist who has done this remarkable research, Kathleen Vohs, has been laudably restrained in discussing the implications of her findings, leaving the task to her readers. Her experiments are profound—her findings suggest that living in a culture that surrounds us with reminders of money may shape our behavior and our attitudes in ways that we do not know about and of  which we may not be proud. Some cultures provide frequent reminders of respect, others constantly remind their members of God, and some societies prime obedience by large images of the Dear Leader. Can there be any doubt that the ubiquitous portraits of the national leader in dictatorial societies not only convey the feeling that “Big Brother Is Watching” but also lead to an actual reduction in spontaneous  thought and independent action? </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The evidence of priming studies suggests that reminding people of their mortality increases the  appeal of authoritarian ideas , which may become reassuring in the context of the terror of death. Other experiments have confirmed Freudian insights about the role of symbols and metaphors in unconscious associations. For example, consider the ambiguous word fragments  W_ _ H and S_ _ P. People who were recently asked to think of an action of which they are ashamed are more likely to complete those fragments as WASH and SOAP and less likely to see WISH and SOUP. Furthermore, merely thinking about stabbing a coworker in the back leaves people more inclined to buy soap, disinfectant, or detergent than batteries, juice, or candy bars.

This is not a surprise: System 2 believes that it is in charge and that it knows the reasons for its choices. Questions are probably cropping up in your mind as well: How is it possible for such trivial manipulations of the context to have such large effects?  Do these experiments demonstrate that we are completely at the mercy of whatever primes the environment provides at any moment? Of course not. The effects of the primes are robust but not necessarily large. Among a hundred voters, only a few whose initial preferences were uncertain will vote differently about a school issue if their  precinct is located in a school rather than in a church—but a  few percent could tip an election. </p></div>

If you had been exposed to a screen saver of floating dollar bills, you too  would likely have picked up fewer pencils to help a clumsy stranger.

<p class ="en"> I conclude with  a perfect demonstration of a priming effect, which was conducted in an office kitchen  at a British university . For many years members of that office had paid for the tea or coffee to which they helped themselves during the day by dropping money into an “honesty box.” A list of suggested prices was posted. One day a banner poster was displayed just above the price list, with no warning or explanation.  For a period of ten weeks a new image was presented each week, either flowers or eyes that appeared to be looking directly at the observer. No one commented on the new decorations, but the contributions to the honesty box changed significantly. The posters and the amounts that people put into the cash box (relative to the amount they consumed) are shown in  figure 4 . They deserve a close look. </p></div>

On average, the users of the kitchen contributed almost three times as much in  “eye weeks” as they did in “flower weeks.” Evidently, a purely symbolic reminder of being watched prodded people into improved behavior.

<p class ="en"> Some years ago, the psychologist Timothy Wilson wrote a book with the evocative title  Strangers to Ourselves . You have now  been  introduced to that stranger  in you, which may be in control of much of what you do, although you rarely have a glimpse of it. System 1 provides the impressions that often turn into your beliefs, and is the source of the impulses that often become your choices and your actions. It offers a tacit interpretation of what happens to you and around you, linking the present with the recent past  and with expectations about the near future. It contains the model of the world that instantly evaluates events as normal or surprising. It is the source of your rapid and often precise intuitive judgments. And it does most of this without your conscious awareness of its activities. System 1 is also, as we will see in the following chapters, the origin of many of the systematic errors in your intuitions. </p></div>

You can think of a cockpit, with a set of dials that indicate the current values of each of these essential variables.

When you are in a state of cognitive ease, you are probably in a good mood, like what you see, believe what you hear, trust your intuitions, and feel that the current situation is comfortably familiar. You are also likely to be relatively casual and superficial in your thinking.  When you feel strained, you are more likely to be vigilant and suspicious, invest more effort in what you are doing, feel less comfortable, and make fewer errors, but you also are less intuitive and less creative than usual. </p></div>

You know, and will know for a while, that these are not the names of minor celebrities. But suppose that a few days from now you are shown a long list  of names, including some minor celebrities and “new” names of people that you have never heard of; your task will be to check every name of a celebrity in the list. There is a substantial probability that you will identify David Stenbill as a well-known person, although you will not (of course) know whether you encountered his name in the context of movies, sports, or politics. Larry Jacoby, the  psychologist who first demonstrated this memory illusion in the laboratory, titled his article  “Becoming Famous Overnight.”  How does this happen? Start by asking yourself how you know whether or not someone is famous. In some cases of truly famous people (or of celebrities in an area you follow), you have a mental file with rich information about a person—think  Albert Einstein, Bono, Hillary Clinton.  But you will have no file of information about David Stenbill if you encounter his name in a few days. All you will have is a sense of familiarity—you have seen this name somewhere. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> David Stenbill, Monica Bigoutski, Shana Tirana.我只是编造了这些名字。如果你在接下来的几分钟内遇到他们中的任何一个，你很可能记得你在哪里看到过他们。 你知道，并且会在一段时间内知道，这些不是小名人的名字。但是，假设从现在开始，你会看到一长串  ，包括一些小名人和你从未听说过的 "新 "名字；你的任务是检查列表中的每个名人的名字。有很大概率你会把大卫-斯滕比尔认定为一个知名人士，尽管你不会（当然）知道你是否在电影、体育或政治方面遇到过他的名字。 拉里-雅各比，这位在实验室中首次证明这种记忆错觉的  心理学家，将他的文章命名为 "一夜成名" 。这种情况是如何发生的？首先要问自己，你是如何知道某人是否出名的。在一些真正的名人（或你所关注的某个领域的名人）的情况下，你有一个心理档案，里面有关于一个人的丰富信息--想想 阿尔伯特-爱因斯坦、博诺、希拉里-克林顿。  但是，如果你在几天后遇到大卫-斯滕比尔的名字，你将没有关于他的信息档案。 你所拥有的只是一种熟悉感--你曾在某个地方见过这个名字。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Jacoby  nicely stated the problem : “The experience of familiarity has a simple but powerful quality of ‘pastness’ that seems to indicate that it is a direct reflection of prior experience.” This quality of pastness  is an illusion. The truth is, as Jacoby and many followers have shown, that the name David Stenbill will look familiar when you see it  because you will see it more clearly . Words that you have seen before become easier to see again—you can identify them better than other words when they are shown very briefly or masked by noise, and you will be quicker (by a few hundredths of a second) to read  them than to read other words. In short, you experience greater cognitive ease in perceiving a word you have seen earlier, and it is this sense of ease that gives you  the impression of familiarity . </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 雅各比 很好地说明了这个问题 ："熟悉的经验有一种简单而强大的'过去性'的品质，似乎表明它是先前经验的直接反映"。这种pastness的特质  ，是一种错觉。事实是，正如雅各比和许多追随者所证明的那样，当你看到大卫-斯滕比尔这个名字时，会显得很熟悉 ，因为你会更清楚地看到它 。你以前见过的词会变得更容易再次看到--当它们被非常短暂地显示出来或被噪音掩盖时，你能比其他词更好地识别它们，而且你阅读  ，会比阅读其他词更快（几百分之一秒）。简而言之，你在感知一个你以前见过的词时，会体验到更大的认知轻松感，正是这种轻松感让你产生了 熟悉的印象 。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Figure 5  suggests a way to test this. Choose a completely new word, make it easier to see, and it will be more likely to have the quality of pastness. Indeed, a new word is more likely to be recognized  as familiar if it is unconsciously primed by showing it for a few milliseconds just before the test, or if it is shown in sharper contrast than some other words in the list. The link also operates in the other direction. Imagine you are shown a list of words that are more or less out of focus. Some of the words are severely blurred, others less so, and your task is to identify the words that  are shown more clearly. A word that you have seen recently will appear to be clearer than unfamiliar words. As  figure 5  indicates, the various ways of inducing cognitive ease or strain are interchangeable; you may not know precisely what it is that makes things cognitively easy or strained. This is how the illusion of familiarity comes about. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 图5 提出了一个测试方法。 选择一个全新的词，让它更容易被看到，它将更有可能具有pastness的特质。事实上，如果在测试前无意识地显示一个新词几毫秒，或者如果它比列表中的其他一些词有更鲜明的对比，那么这个新词更有可能被识别为熟悉的  。这种联系也在另一个方向上运作。 想象一下，给你看一个或多或少失焦的单词列表。有些单词严重模糊，有些则不那么模糊，你的任务是找出  ，使其显示得更清楚。一个你最近见过的词会比不熟悉的词显得更清晰。 如图5 所示，诱发认知轻松或紧张的各种方式是可以互换的；你可能并不确切知道是什么让事情在认知上变得轻松或紧张。 这就是熟悉感的错觉是如何产生的。 </p></div>

But it was psychologists who discovered that you do not have to repeat the entire statement of a fact or idea to make it appear true. People who were repeatedly exposed to the phrase  “the body temperature of a chicken”  were more likely to accept as true the statement that “the body temperature of a chicken is 144°”  (or any other arbitrary number). The familiarity of one phrase in the statement sufficed to make the whole statement feel familiar, and therefore true. If you cannot remember the source of a statement, and have no way to relate it to other things you know, you have no option but to go with the sense of cognitive ease. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 图5 的教训是，如果判断是基于认知轻松或紧张的印象，就不可避免地出现可预测的错觉。任何使联想机器更容易顺利运行的东西也会使信仰产生偏差。 使人们相信假话的一个可靠方法是经常重复，因为熟悉的东西不容易与真理区分  。专制机构和营销人员一直都知道这个事实。 但是，是心理学家发现，你不必重复一个事实或想法的全部陈述来使它看起来是真的。反复接触到 "鸡的体温 " 这一短语的人更有可能接受 "鸡的体温是144°"这一说法为真  （或任何其他任意数字）。声明中一个短语的熟悉程度足以使整个声明感到熟悉，因此是真的。如果你记不起一个说法的来源，也没有办法把它与你知道的其他事情联系起来，你就没有选择，只能跟着认知的轻松感走。 </p></div>

What psychologists do believe is that all of us live much of our life guided by the impressions of System 1—and we often do not know the source of these impressions. How do you know that a statement is true?

The trouble is that there may be other causes for your feeling of ease—including the quality of the font and the appealing rhythm of the prose—and you have no simple way of tracing your feelings to their source.

The famed psychologist Robert Zajonc dedicated much of his career to the study of the link between the repetition of an arbitrary stimulus and the mild affection that  people eventually have for it. Zajonc called it the  mere exposure effect . A demonstration conducted in the student newspapers of the University of Michigan and of Michigan State University is one of my  favorite experiments . For a period of some weeks, an ad-like box appeared on the front page of the paper, which contained one of the following Turkish (or Turkish-sounding) words:  kadirga ,  saricik ,  biwonjni ,  nansoma , and  iktitaf . The frequency with which the words were repeated varied: one of the words was shown only once, the others appeared on two, five, ten, or twenty-five separate occasions. (The words that were presented most often in one of the university papers were the least frequent in the other.) No explanation was offered, and readers’ queries were answered by the statement that  “the purchaser of the display wished for anonymity.” </p></div>

They still end up liking the words or pictures that were presented more frequently. As should be clear by now, System 1 can respond to impressions of events of which System 2 is unaware.

<p class ="en"> Zajonc argued that the effect of repetition on liking is a profoundly important  biological fact, and that it extends to all animals. To survive in a frequently dangerous world, an organism should react cautiously to a novel stimulus, with withdrawal and fear. Survival prospects are poor for an animal that is not suspicious of novelty. However, it is also adaptive for the initial caution to fade if the stimulus is actually safe. The mere exposure effect occurs, Zajonc claimed,  because the repeated exposure of a stimulus is followed by nothing bad. Such a stimulus will eventually become a safety signal, and safety is good. Obviously, this argument is not restricted to humans. To make that point, one of Zajonc’s associates exposed two sets of fertile chicken eggs to different tones. After they hatched, the chicks consistently emitted fewer distress calls when exposed  to the tone they had heard while  inhabiting the shell . </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> Zajonc认为，重复对喜好的影响是一个深刻而重要的  生物学事实，它延伸到所有的动物。为了在一个经常有危险的世界中生存，一个有机体应该对新的刺激作出谨慎的反应，有退缩和恐惧。 对于一个不怀疑新事物的动物，生存前景是很差的。然而，如果刺激物实际上是安全的，那么最初的谨慎也是适应性的，会逐渐消失。Zajonc声称，仅仅是暴露效应的发生，  ，因为重复暴露一个刺激后没有什么坏处。这样的刺激最终会成为一个安全信号，而安全是好事。显然，这种说法并不限于人类。为了说明这一点，Zajonc的一位同事将两组受精鸡蛋暴露在不同的色调下。孵化后，当雏鸟接触到它们在 壳内时 听到的音调时，  ，它们发出的求救信号始终较少。 </p></div>

One of the teams raised two questions: Can people feel that a triad of words has a solution before they know what the solution is? How does mood influence performance in this task? To find out, they first made some of their subjects happy and others sad, by  asking them to think for several minutes about happy or sad episodes in their lives. Then they presented these subjects with a series of triads, half of them linked (such as  dive ,  light ,  rocket ) and half unlinked (such as  dream ,  ball ,  book ), and instructed them to press one of two keys very quickly to indicate their guess about whether the triad was linked. The time allowed for this guess, 2 seconds,  was much too short for the actual solution to come to anyone’s mind. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 近年来，几个研究RAT的德国心理学家团队在认知轻松度方面有了显著的发现。其中一个小组提出了两个问题：人们在知道解决方案是什么之前，能否感觉到一个三段式的词语有一个解决方案？心情如何影响这项任务的表现？为了找出答案，他们首先让一些受试者感到高兴，另一些则感到悲伤，方法是：  ，让他们思考几分钟他们生活中的快乐或悲伤事件。然后，他们向这些受试者展示了一系列的三要素，其中一半是有联系的（如 潜水 、 光 、 火箭 ），一半是没有联系的（ 如梦 、 球 、 书 ），并指示他们快速按下两个键中的一个，以表明他们对三要素是否有联系的猜测。允许这种猜测的时间为2秒，  ，这对任何人的实际解决方案来说都太短。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The first surprise is that people’s guesses are much more accurate than they would be by chance. I find this astonishing. A sense of cognitive ease is apparently generated by a very faint signal from the associative machine, which “knows” that the three words are coherent (share an association) long before the  association is retrieved . The role of cognitive ease in the judgment was confirmed experimentally by another German team: manipulations that  increase cognitive ease  (priming, a clear font, pre-exposing words) all increase the tendency to see the words as linked. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 第一个惊喜是，人们的猜测比偶然的猜测要准确得多。我觉得这很让人吃惊。认知上的轻松感显然是由联想机发出的一个非常微弱的信号产生的，它在 联想被检索 之前很长时间就 "知道 "这三个词是连贯的（共享一个联想）  。认知上的轻松感在判断中的作用被另一个德国团队在实验中证实： 增加认知轻松感的 操作（打底、清晰的字体、预先曝光的词）都会增加将这些词视为联系的倾向性。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Another remarkable discovery is the powerful effect of mood on this intuitive performance. The experimenters computed an “intuition index” to measure accuracy.  They found that putting the participants in a good  mood before the test by having them think happy thoughts more than  doubled accuracy . An even more striking result is that unhappy subjects were completely incapable of performing the intuitive task accurately; their guesses were no better than random. Mood evidently affects the operation of System 1: when we are uncomfortable and unhappy, we lose  touch with our intuition. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 另一个引人注目的发现是情绪对这种直觉表现的强大影响。实验者计算了一个 "直觉指数 "来衡量准确性。  他们发现，在测试前让参与者处于良好的 ，让他们思考快乐的想法， 使准确性提高了一倍 以上。一个更惊人的结果是，不快乐的受试者完全没有能力准确地执行直觉任务；他们的猜测并不比随机的好。情绪显然会影响系统1的运作：当我们不舒服和不快乐的时候，我们就会与我们的直觉失去  。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> These findings add to the growing evidence that good mood, intuition, creativity, gullibility, and increased reliance on System 1  form a cluster . At the other pole, sadness, vigilance, suspicion, an analytic approach, and increased effort also go together. A happy mood loosens the control of System 2 over performance: when in a good mood, people become more intuitive  and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors. Here again, as in the mere exposure effect, the connection makes biological sense. A good mood is a signal that things are generally going well, the environment is safe, and it is all right to let one’s guard down. A bad mood indicates that things are not going very well, there may be a threat, and vigilance is required. Cognitive  ease is both a cause and a consequence of a pleasant feeling. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 这些发现增加了越来越多的证据，即良好的情绪、直觉、创造力、轻信和增加对系统1的依赖 形成一个集群 。在另一极，悲伤、警惕、怀疑、分析的方法和增加的努力也是相辅相成的。快乐的心情会放松系统2对表现的控制：当心情好的时候，人们会变得更有直觉  ，更有创造力，但也不那么警觉，更容易出现逻辑错误。在这里，与单纯的暴露效应一样，这种联系也具有生物学意义。良好的情绪是一个信号，表明事情总体上进展顺利，环境安全，让人放松警惕是完全正确的。糟糕的情绪表明事情不太顺利，可能有威胁，需要警惕。认知  ，轻松既是愉快的感觉的原因，也是结果。 </p></div>

This  smiling reaction  to coherence appears in subjects who are told nothing about common associates; they are merely shown a vertically arranged triad of words and instructed to press the space bar after they have read it.

<p class ="en"> The evidence that we have about good feelings, cognitive ease, and the intuition of coherence is, as scientists say, correlational but not necessarily causal. Cognitive ease and smiling occur together, but do the good feelings actually lead to intuitions of coherence? Yes, they do. The proof comes from a clever experimental approach that has become increasingly popular.  Some participants were given a cover story that provided an alternative interpretation for their good feeling: they were told about music played in their  earphones that  “previous research showed that this music influences the emotional reactions of individuals.”  This story completely eliminates the intuition of coherence. The finding shows that the brief emotional response that follows the presentation  of a triad of words (pleasant if the triad is coherent, unpleasant otherwise) is actually the basis of judgments of coherence. There is nothing here that System 1 cannot do. Emotional changes are now expected, and because they are unsurprising they are not linked causally to the words. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 我们所掌握的关于良好感觉、认知轻松和一致性直觉的证据，正如科学家所说，是相关的，但不一定是因果关系。认知上的轻松和微笑是一起发生的，但这种良好的感觉是否真的导致了一致性的直觉？是的，他们是这样做的。证据来自于一种聪明的实验方法，这种方法已经变得越来越流行。  ，一些参与者得到了一个封面故事，为他们的良好感觉提供了另一种解释：他们被告知关于他们的 耳机中播放的音乐， "以前的研究表明，这种音乐影响个人的情绪反应" 。这个故事完全消除了连贯性的直觉。这一发现表明，在呈现  ，一个三联词（如果三联词是连贯的，则是愉快的，否则是不愉快的）之后的短暂情绪反应实际上是连贯性判断的基础。这里没有什么是系统1不能做的。 情绪的变化现在是可以预期的，而且因为它们是不出人意料的，所以与文字没有因果关系。 </p></div>

When the hour is near, you may be expecting the sound of the door as your child returns from school; when the door opens you expect the sound of a familiar voice. You will be surprised  if an actively expected event does not occur.

<p class ="en"> A single incident may make a recurrence less surprising. Some years ago, my wife and I were vacationing  in a small island resort on the Great Barrier Reef. There are only forty guest rooms on the island. When we came to dinner, we were surprised to meet an acquaintance, a psychologist named Jon. We greeted each other warmly and commented on the coincidence. Jon left the resort the next day. About two weeks later, we were in a theater in London. A latecomer sat next to me after the lights went down.  When the lights came up for the intermission, I saw that my neighbor was Jon. My wife and I commented later that we were simultaneously conscious of two facts: first, this was a more remarkable coincidence than the first meeting; second, we were distinctly  less  surprised to meet Jon on the second occasion than we had been on the first. Evidently, the first meeting had somehow changed the idea  of Jon in our minds. He was now “the psychologist who shows up when we travel abroad.” We (System 2) knew this was a ludicrous idea, but our System 1 had made it seem almost normal to meet Jon in strange places. We would have experienced much more surprise if we had met any acquaintance other than Jon in the next seat of a London theater. By any measure of probability, meeting Jon in the theater was  much less likely than meeting any one of our hundreds of acquaintances—yet meeting Jon seemed more normal. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Under some conditions, passive expectations quickly turn active, as we found in another coincidence. On a Sunday evening some years ago, we were driving from New York City to Princeton, as we had been doing every week for a long time. We saw an unusual sight: a car on fire by the side of  the road. When we reached the same stretch of road the following Sunday, another car was burning there. Here again, we found that we were distinctly less surprised on the second occasion than we had been on the first. This was now “the place where cars catch fire.” Because the circumstances of the recurrence were the same, the second incident was sufficient to create an active expectation: for months,  perhaps for years, after the event much less likely than meeting one of our hundreds of acquaintances— we were reminded of burning cars whenever we reached that spot of the road and were quite prepared to see another one (but of course we never did). </p></div>

<p class ="en"> A story in Nassim Taleb’s  The Black Swan  illustrates this automatic search for causality. He reports that bond prices initially rose on the day of Saddam Hussein’s capture in his hiding place in Iraq. Investors were  apparently seeking safer assets that morning, and the Bloomberg News service flashed this headline:  U.S. TREASURIES RISE; HUSSEIN CAPTURE MAY NOT CURB TERRORISM . Half an hour later, bond prices fell back and the revised headline read:  U.S. TREASURIES FALL; HUSSEIN CAPTURE BOOSTS ALLURE OF RISKY ASSETS . Obviously, Hussein’s capture was the major event of the day, and because of the way the automatic  search for causes shapes our thinking, that event was destined to be the explanation of whatever happened in the market on that day. The two headlines look superficially like explanations of what happened in the market, but a statement that can explain two contradictory outcomes explains nothing at all. In fact, all the headlines do is satisfy our need for coherence: a large event is supposed  to have consequences, and consequences need causes to explain them. We have limited information about what happened on a day, and System 1 is adept at finding a coherent causal story that links the fragments of knowledge at its disposal. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The aristocratic Belgian psychologist Albert Michotte published a book in 1945 (translated into English in 1963) that overturned centuries of thinking about causality, going back at least to Hume’s examination of the association of ideas. The commonly accepted wisdom was that we infer physical causality from repeated observations  of correlations among events. We have had myriad experiences in which we saw one object in motion touching another object, which immediately starts to move, often (but not always) in the same direction. This is what happens when a billiard ball hits another, and it is also what happens when you knock over a vase by brushing against it. Michotte had a different idea: he argued that we  see  causality,  just as directly as we see color. To make his point, he created episodes in which a black square drawn on paper is seen in motion; it comes into contact with another square, which immediately begins to move. The observers know that there is no real physical contact, but they nevertheless have a powerful “illusion of causality.” If the second object starts moving instantly, they describe it as  having been “launched” by the first. Experiments have shown that six-month-old infants see the sequence of events as a cause-effect scenario, and they  indicate surprise  when the sequence is altered. We are evidently ready from birth to have  impressions  of causality, which do not depend on reasoning about patterns of causation. They are products of System 1. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 比利时贵族心理学家Albert Michotte在1945年出版了一本书（1963年被翻译成英文），推翻了几个世纪以来关于因果关系的思考，至少可以追溯到休谟对观念关联的研究。 普遍接受的智慧是，我们从反复观察  ，推断出事件之间的相关性的物理因果关系。我们有无数的经验，我们看到一个运动中的物体接触到另一个物体，后者立即开始运动，往往（但不总是）朝同一方向运动。 这就是台球撞到另一个球时发生的情况，也是你用手拂过花瓶时发生的情况。 Michotte有一个不同的想法：他认为，我们 看到 因果关系，  ，就像我们看到颜色一样直接。为了说明他的观点，他创造了一些情节，在这些情节中，人们看到一个画在纸上的黑色方块在运动；它与另一个方块接触，后者立即开始移动。观察者知道没有真正的物理接触，但他们还是有一个强大的 "因果关系的幻觉"。如果第二个物体瞬间开始移动，他们将其描述为：  ，被第一个物体 "发射"。实验表明，6个月大的婴儿把事件的顺序看成是因果关系，当顺序被改变时，他们会 表示惊讶 。 显然，我们从出生起就准备好了对因果关系的 印象 ，这并不取决于对因果关系模式的推理。 它们是系统1的产物。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In 1944, at about the same time as  Michotte published his demonstrations of physical causality, the psychologists Fritz Heider and Mary-Ann Simmel used a method similar to Michotte’s to demonstrate the perception of  intentional  causality. They made a film, which lasts all of one minute and forty seconds, in which you see a large triangle, a small triangle, and a circle moving around a shape that looks like a schematic view of a  house with an open door. Viewers see an aggressive large triangle bullying a smaller triangle, a terrified circle, the circle and the small triangle joining forces to defeat the bully; they also observe much interaction around a door and then an  explosive finale . The perception of intention and emotion is irresistible; only people afflicted by autism do not experience it. All this is entirely  in your mind, of course. Your mind is ready and even eager to identify agents, assign them personality traits and specific intentions, and view their actions as expressing individual propensities. Here again, the evidence is that we are born prepared to make intentional attributions: infants under one year old  identify bullies and victims , and expect a pursuer to follow the most direct path in  attempting to catch whatever it is chasing. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The experience of freely willed action is quite separate from physical causality. Although it is your hand that picks up the salt, you do not think of the event in terms of a chain of physical causation. You experience it as caused by a decision that a disembodied  you  made, because you wanted to add salt to your food. Many people find it natural to  describe their soul as the source and the cause of their actions. The psychologist Paul Bloom, writing in  The Atlantic  in 2005, presented the provocative claim that our inborn readiness to separate physical and intentional causality explains the near universality of religious beliefs. He observes that “we perceive the world of objects as essentially separate from the world of minds, making it  possible for us to envision soulless bodies and bodiless souls.” The two modes of causation that we are set to perceive make it natural for us to accept the two central beliefs of many religions: an immaterial divinity is the ultimate cause of the physical world, and immortal souls temporarily control our bodies while we live and leave them behind  as we die . In Bloom’s view, the two concepts of  causality were shaped separately by evolutionary forces, building the origins of religion into the structure of System 1. </p></div>

The system and the machine are fictions; my reason for using them is that they fit the way we think about causes. Heider’s triangles and circles are not really agents—it is just very easy and natural to think of them that way. It is a matter of mental economy.

Jumping to conclusions is efficient if the conclusions are likely to be correct and the costs of an occasional mistake acceptable, and if the jump saves much time and effort.  Jumping to conclusions is risky when the situation is unfamiliar, the stakes are high, and there is no time to collect more information. These are the circumstances in which intuitive errors are probable, which may be prevented by a deliberate intervention of System 2. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> As for Ann, you probably imagined a woman with money on her mind, walking toward a building with tellers and secure vaults. But this plausible interpretation  is not the only possible one; the sentence is ambiguous. If an earlier sentence had been “They were floating gently down the river,” you would have imagined an altogether different scene. When you have just been thinking of a river, the word  bank  is not associated with money. In the absence of an explicit context, System 1 generated a likely context on its own. We know that it is System 1 because  you were not aware of the choice or of the possibility of another interpretation. Unless you have been canoeing recently, you probably spend more time going to banks than floating on rivers, and you resolved the ambiguity accordingly. When uncertain, System 1 bets on an answer, and the bets are guided by experience. The rules of the betting are intelligent: recent events and the current context  have the most weight in determining an interpretation. When no recent event comes to mind, more distant memories govern. Among your earliest and most memorable experiences was singing your ABCs; you did not sing your A13Cs. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The psychologist Daniel Gilbert,  widely known as the author of  Stumbling on Happiness , once wrote an essay, titled “How Mental Systems Believe,” in which he developed a theory of believing and unbelieving that he traced to the seventeenth-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza. Gilbert proposed  that understanding a statement must begin with an attempt to believe it: you must first know what the idea would mean if it were true. Only  then can you decide whether or not to  unbelieve  it. The initial attempt to believe is an automatic operation of System 1, which involves the construction of the best possible interpretation of the situation. Even a nonsensical statement, Gilbert argues, will evoke initial belief. Try his example: “whitefish eat candy.” You probably were aware of vague impressions of fish and candy as an automatic  process of associative memory searched for links between the two ideas that would make sense of the nonsense. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Gilbert sees unbelieving as an operation of System 2, and he reported an  elegant experiment  to make his point. The participants saw nonsensical assertions, such as “a dinca is a flame,” followed after a few seconds by a single word, “true” or “false.” They were later tested for their  memory of which sentences had been labeled “true.” In one condition of the experiment subjects were required to hold digits in memory during the task. The disruption of System 2 had a selective effect: it made it difficult for people to “unbelieve” false sentences. In a later test of memory, the depleted participants ended up thinking that many of the false sentences were true. The moral is significant:  when System 2 is otherwise engaged, we will believe almost anything. System 1 is gullible and biased to believe, System 2 is in charge of doubting and unbelieving, but System 2 is sometimes busy, and often lazy. Indeed, there is evidence that people are more likely to be influenced by empty persuasive messages, such as commercials, when they are tired and depleted. </p></div>

When asked, “Is Sam friendly?” different instances of Sam’s behavior will come to mind than would if you had been asked “Is Sam unfriendly?” A deliberate search for confirming evidence, known as  positive test strategy , is also how System 2 tests a hypothesis. Contrary to the rules of philosophers of science, who advise testing hypotheses by trying  to refute them, people (and scientists, quite often) seek data that are likely to be compatible with the beliefs they currently hold. The confirmatory bias of System 1 favors uncritical acceptance of suggestions and exaggeration of the likelihood of extreme and improbable events. If you are asked about the probability of a tsunami hitting California within the next thirty years, the images that  come to your mind are likely to be images of tsunamis, in the manner Gilbert proposed for nonsense statements such as “whitefish eat candy.” You will be prone to overestimate the probability of a disaster. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The sequence in which we observe  characteristics of a person is often determined by chance. Sequence matters, however, because the halo effect increases the weight of first impressions, sometimes to the point that subsequent information is mostly wasted. Early in my career as a professor, I graded students’ essay exams in the conventional way. I would pick up one test booklet at a time and read all that student’s essays in immediate  succession, grading them as I went. I would then compute the total and go on to the next student. I eventually noticed that my evaluations of the essays in each booklet were strikingly homogeneous. I began to suspect that my grading exhibited a halo effect, and that the first question I scored had a disproportionate effect on the overall grade. The mechanism was simple: if I had given a high  score to the first essay, I gave the student the benefit of the doubt whenever I encountered a vague or ambiguous statement later on. This seemed reasonable. Surely a student who had done so well on the first essay would not make a foolish mistake in the second one! But there was a serious problem with my way of doing things. If a student had written two essays, one strong and one weak, I would  end up with different final grades depending on which essay I read first. I had told the students that the two essays had equal weight, but that was not true: the first one had a much greater impact on the final grade than the second. This was unacceptable. </p></div>

Soon after switching to the new method, I made a disconcerting observation: my confidence in my grading was now much lower than it had been. The reason was that I frequently experienced a discomfort that was new  to me. When I was disappointed with a student’s second essay and went to the back page of the booklet to enter a poor grade, I occasionally discovered that I had given a top grade to the same student’s first essay. I also noticed that I was tempted to reduce the discrepancy by changing the grade that I had not yet written down, and found it hard to  follow the simple rule of never yielding to that  temptation.

<p class ="en"> The procedure I adopted to tame the halo effect conforms to a general principle: decorrelate error! To understand how this principle works, imagine that a large number of observers are shown glass jars containing pennies and are challenged to estimate the number  of pennies in each jar. As James Surowiecki explained in his best-selling  The  Wisdom of Crowds , this is the kind of task in which individuals do very poorly, but pools of individual judgments do remarkably well. Some individuals greatly overestimate the true number, others underestimate it, but when many judgments are averaged, the average tends to be quite accurate. The mechanism is straightforward:  all individuals look at the same jar, and all their judgments have a common basis. On the other hand, the errors that individuals make are independent of the errors made by others, and (in the absence of a systematic bias) they tend to average to zero. However, the magic of error reduction works well only when the observations are independent and their errors uncorrelated. If the observers  share a bias, the aggregation of judgments will not reduce it. Allowing the observers to influence each other effectively reduces the size of the sample, and with it the precision of the group estimate. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 我所采用的驯服光环效应的程序符合一个一般原则：装饰误差！"。为了理解这一原理的作用，想象一下，让大量的观察者看到装有便士的玻璃罐，并让他们估计每个罐子里的便士数量  。正如詹姆斯-苏洛维茨基在他的畅销书 《 人群的智慧 》 中所解释的那样，这是一种个人做得很差的任务，但个人判断的集合体却做得非常好。有些人大大高估了真实的数字，有些人则低估了它，但当许多判断被平均化时，平均数往往是相当准确的。其机制很简单：  ，所有的人都看着同一个罐子，他们的所有判断都有一个共同的基础。另一方面，个人所犯的错误与其他人的错误无关，而且（在没有系统性偏见的情况下）它们的平均值趋向于零。然而，只有当观察结果是独立的，且其误差不相关时，减少误差的魔法才会很有效。如果观察者  ，共享一个偏见，那么判断的汇总将不会减少它。允许观察者相互影响，可以有效地减少样本的大小，并随之减少群体估计的精确度。 </p></div>

Within ten minutes of his arrival,  a store manager confronted him and told him he could no longer speak with the union employees on the floor of the store. Instead, he would have to see them in a back room while they were on break. Such a request is allowed by the union contract with Thrifty Drug but had never before been enforced. When Mr. Thornton objected, he was told that he had the choice of conforming to these requirements,  leaving the store, or being arrested. At this point, Mr. Thornton indicated to the manager that he had always been allowed to speak to employees on the floor for as much as ten minutes, as long as no  business was disrupted, and that he would rather be arrested than change the procedure of his routine visit. The manager then called the police and had Mr. Thornton handcuffed in the store for trespassing.  After he was booked and put into a holding cell for a brief time, all charges were dropped. Mr. Thornton is suing Thrifty Drug for false arrest. </p></div>

System 2 receives questions or generates them: in either case it directs attention and searches memory to find the answers. System 1 operates differently. It  continuously monitors what is going on outside and inside the mind, and continuously generates assessments of various aspects of the situation without specific intention and with little or no effort. These  basic assessments  play an important role in intuitive judgment, because they are easily substituted for more difficult questions—this is the essential idea of the heuristics and biases approach.  Two other features of System 1 also support the substitution of one judgment for another. One is the ability to translate values across dimensions, which you do in answering a question that most people find easy: “If Sam were as tall as he is intelligent, how tall would he be?” Finally, there is the mental shotgun. An intention of System 2 to answer a specific question or evaluate a particular  attribute of the situation automatically triggers other computations, including basic assessments. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> For a specific example of a  basic assessment , consider the ability to discriminate friend from foe at a glance. This contributes to one’s chances of survival in a dangerous world, and such a specialized capability has indeed evolved. Alex Todorov, my colleague at Princeton, has explored the  biological roots  of the rapid judgments of how safe it is to interact with a stranger. He showed that we  are endowed with an ability to evaluate, in a single glance at a stranger’s face, two potentially crucial facts about that person: how dominant (and therefore potentially threatening) he is, and how trustworthy he is, whether his intentions are more likely to be  friendly or hostile . The shape of the face provides the cues for assessing dominance: a “strong” square chin is one such cue. Facial  expression (smile or frown) provides the cues for assessing the stranger’s intentions. The combination of a square chin with a turned-down mouth  may spell trouble . The accuracy of face reading is far from perfect: round chins are not a reliable indicator of meekness, and smiles can (to some extent) be faked. Still, even an imperfect ability to assess strangers confers a survival advantage. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> This  ancient mechanism is put to a novel use in the modern world: it has some influence on how people vote. Todorov showed his students pictures of men’s faces, sometimes for as little as one-tenth of a second, and asked them to rate the faces on various attributes, including likability and competence. Observers agreed quite well on those ratings. The faces that Todorov showed were not a random set:  they were the campaign portraits of politicians competing for elective office. Todorov then compared the results of the electoral races to the ratings of competence that Princeton students had made, based on brief exposure to photographs and without any political context. In about 70% of the races for senator, congressman, and governor, the election winner was the candidate whose face had earned  a higher rating  of competence. This striking result was quickly confirmed in national elections in Finland, in zoning board elections in England, and in various electoral contests in  Australia, Germany, and Mexico . Surprisingly (at least to me), ratings of competence were far more predictive of voting outcomes in Todorov’s study than ratings of likability. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 这种  古老的机制在现代世界被赋予了新奇的用途：它对人们的投票方式有一定的影响。 托多罗夫向他的学生展示了男人的脸部照片，有时只有十分之一秒，并要求他们对这些脸部的各种属性进行评分，包括可亲性和能力。观察员们对这些评级的意见相当一致。托多罗夫展示的面孔不是随机的：  ，它们是竞争选举职位的政治家的竞选画像。然后，托多罗夫将选举结果与普林斯顿大学学生的能力评分进行了比较，这些评分是基于对照片的短暂接触，没有任何政治背景。在大约70%的参议员、众议员和州长的竞选中，选举获胜者是其面孔获得  ，能力评分较高的候选人 。这一引人注目的结果很快在芬兰的全国选举、英国的区划委员会选举以及 澳大利亚、德国和墨西哥 的各种选举竞争中得到了证实。令人惊讶的是（至少对我来说），在托多罗夫的研究中，对能力的评价远比对喜好的评价更能预测投票结果。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Todorov has found that people judge  competence by combining the two dimensions of strength and trustworthiness. The faces that exude competence combine a strong chin with a slight confident-appearing smile. There is no evidence that these facial features actually predict how well politicians will perform in office. But studies of the brain’s response to winning and losing candidates show that we are biologically predisposed to reject  candidates who lack the attributes we value—in this research, losers evoked stronger indications of (negative) emotional response. This is an example of what I will call a  judgment heuristic  in the following chapters. Voters are attempting to form an impression of how good a candidate will be in office, and they fall back on a simpler assessment that is made quickly and automatically and is available  when System 2 must make its decision. </p></div>

Experiments have shown that a fraction of a second is sufficient for people to register the average length of an array of lines with considerable precision. Furthermore, the accuracy of these judgments is not impaired when the observer is cognitively busy with a memory task. They do not necessarily know how to describe  the average in inches or centimeters, but they will be  very accurate in adjusting the length of another line to match the average. System 2 is not needed to form an impression of the norm of length for an array. System 1 does it, automatically and effortlessly, just as it registers the color of the lines and the fact that they are not parallel.

We asked ourselves how people manage to make judgments of probability without knowing precisely what probability is. We concluded that people must somehow simplify that impossible task, and we set out to find how they do it. Our answer was that when called upon to judge probability,  people actually judge something else and believe they have judged probability. System 1 often makes this move when faced with difficult target questions, if the answer to a related and easier heuristic question comes readily to mind. </p></div>

Your feelings about dolphins and financial  crooks, your current mood, your impressions of the political skill of the primary candidate, or the current standing of the president will readily come to mind.

<p class ="en"> Something is still missing from this story: the answers need to be fitted to the original questions. For example, my feelings about dying  dolphins must be expressed in dollars. Another capability of System 1, intensity matching, is available to solve that problem. Recall that both feelings and contribution dollars are intensity scales. I can feel more or less strongly about dolphins and there is a contribution that matches the intensity of my feelings. The dollar amount that will come to my mind is the matching amount. Similar intensity  matches are possible for all the questions. For example, the political skills of a candidate can range from pathetic to extraordinarily impressive, and the scale of political success can range from the low of “She will be defeated in the primary” to a high of “She will someday be president of the United States.” </p></div>

Of course, System 2 has the opportunity to reject this intuitive answer, or to modify it by incorporating other information. However, a lazy System 2 often follows the path of least effort and endorses a heuristic  answer without much scrutiny of whether it is truly appropriate. You will not be stumped, you will not have to work very hard, and you may not even notice that you did not answer the question you were asked. Furthermore, you may not realize that the target question was difficult, because  an intuitive answer to it came readily to mind . </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The dominance of conclusions over arguments is most pronounced where emotions are involved. The psychologist Paul Slovic has proposed an  affect heuristic  in which people let their likes and dislikes determine their beliefs about  the world. Your political preference determines the arguments that you find compelling. If you like the current health policy, you believe its benefits are substantial and its costs more manageable than the costs of alternatives. If you are a hawk in your attitude toward other nations, you probably think they are relatively weak and likely to submit to your country’s will. If you are a dove, you probably  think they are strong and will not be easily coerced. Your emotional attitude to such things as irradiated food, red meat, nuclear power, tattoos, or motorcycles drives your beliefs about their benefits and their risks. If you dislike any of these things, you probably believe that its risks are high and its benefits negligible. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The primacy of conclusions does not mean that your mind is completely  closed and that your opinions are wholly immune to information and sensible reasoning. Your beliefs, and even your emotional attitude, may change (at least a little) when you learn that the risk of an activity you disliked is smaller than you thought. However, the information about lower risks will also change your  view of the benefits  (for the better) even if nothing was said about benefits in  the information you received. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> We see here a new side of the “personality” of System 2. Until now I have mostly described it as a more or less acquiescent monitor, which allows considerable leeway to System 1. I have also presented System 2 as active in deliberate memory search, complex computations, comparisons, planning, and choice. In the bat-and-ball problem and in many other examples of the  interplay between the two systems, it appeared that System 2 is ultimately in charge, with the ability to resist the suggestions of System 1, slow things down, and impose logical analysis. Self-criticism is one of the functions of System 2. In the context of attitudes, however, System 2 is more of an apologist for the emotions of System 1 than a critic of those emotions—an endorser rather than  an enforcer. Its search for information and arguments is mostly constrained to information that is consistent with existing beliefs,  not with an intention to examine them. An active, coherence-seeking System 1 suggests solutions to an undemanding System 2. </p></div>

System 1 is highly adept in one form of thinking—it automatically and effortlessly identifies  causal connections between events, sometimes even when the connection is spurious. When told about the high-incidence counties, you immediately assumed that these counties are different from other counties for a reason, that there must be a cause that explains this difference.

Next, imagine a very patient person (or a robot) who blindly draws 4 marbles from the urn, records the number of red balls in the  sample, throws the balls back into the urn, and then does it all again, many times. If you summarize the results, you will find that the outcome “2 red, 2 white” occurs (almost exactly) 6 times as often as the outcome “4 red” or “4 white.” This relationship is a mathematical fact. You can predict the outcome of repeated sampling from an urn just as confidently as you can predict what will happen  if you hit an egg with a hammer. You cannot predict every detail of how the shell will shatter, but you can be sure of the general idea.

<p class ="en"> We started from a fact that calls for a cause: the incidence of kidney cancer varies widely across counties and the differences are systematic. The explanation I offered is statistical: extreme outcomes (both high and low) are more likely to be found in small than in large samples. This explanation is not causal.  The small population of a county neither causes nor prevents cancer; it merely allows the incidence of cancer to be much higher (or much lower) than it is in the larger population. The deeper truth is that there is nothing to explain. The incidence of cancer is not truly lower or higher than normal in a county with a small population, it just appears to be so in a particular year because of  an accident of sampling. If we repeat the analysis next year, we will observe the same general pattern of extreme results in the small samples, but the counties where cancer was common last year will not necessarily have a high incidence this year. If this is the case, the differences between dense and rural counties do not really count as facts: they are what scientists call artifacts, observations  that are produced entirely by some aspect of the method of research—in this case, by differences in sample size. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> For a research psychologist, sampling variation is not a curiosity; it is a nuisance  and a costly obstacle, which turns the undertaking of every research project into a gamble. Suppose that you wish to confirm the hypothesis that the vocabulary of the average six-year-old girl is larger than the vocabulary of an average boy of the same age. The hypothesis is true in the population; the average vocabulary of girls is indeed larger. Girls and boys vary a great deal, however,  and by the luck of the draw you could select a sample in which the difference is inconclusive, or even one in which boys actually score higher. If you are the researcher, this outcome is costly to you because you have wasted time and effort, and failed to confirm a hypothesis that was in fact true. Using a sufficiently large sample is the only way to reduce the risk. Researchers who pick too small  a sample leave themselves at the mercy of sampling luck. </p></div>

They use their judgment, which is commonly flawed. An article I had read shortly before the debate with Amos demonstrated the mistake that researchers made (they  still do) by a dramatic observation. The author pointed out that psychologists commonly chose samples so small that they exposed themselves to a  50% risk of failing  to confirm their true hypotheses! No researcher in his right mind would accept such a risk. A plausible explanation was that psychologists’ decisions about sample size reflected prevalent intuitive misconceptions of the extent of sampling  variation. </p></div>

Amos collected the responses of a group of sophisticated participants (including authors of two statistical textbooks) at a meeting of the Society of Mathematical Psychology.

Because the events are independent and because the outcomes B and G are (approximately) equally  likely, then any possible sequence of six births is as likely as any other. Even now that you know this conclusion is true, it remains counterintuitive, because only the third sequence appears random. As expected, B GBBGB is judged much more likely than the other two sequences. We are pattern seekers, believers in a coherent world, in which regularities (such as a sequence of six girls) appear not  by accident but as a result of mechanical causality or of someone’s intention. We do not expect to see regularity produced by a random process, and when we detect what appears to be a rule, we quickly reject the idea that the process is truly random. Random processes produce many sequences that convince people that the process is not random after all. You can see why assuming causality could have  had evolutionary advantages. It is part of the general vigilance that we have inherited from ancestors. We are automatically on the lookout for the possibility that the environment has changed.

In our article on representativeness, Amos and I cited the statistician William Feller, who illustrated the ease with which people see patterns where none exists. During the intensive rocket bombing of London in World War II, it was generally believed that the bombing  could not be random  because a map of the hits revealed conspicuous gaps. Some suspected that  German spies  were located in the unharmed areas. A careful statistical analysis revealed that the distribution of hits was typical of a random process—and typical as well in evoking a strong impression that it was not random. “To the untrained eye,” Feller remarks, “randomness appears as regularity or tendency to cluster.” </p></div>

The Yom Kippur War broke out in 1973, and my only significant contribution to the war effort was to advise high officers in the Israeli Air Force to stop an investigation. The air war initially went quite badly for Israel, because of the unexpectedly good performance of Egyptian ground-to-air missiles. Losses were high, and they appeared  to be unevenly distributed. I was told of two squadrons flying from the same base, one of which had lost four planes while the other had lost none. An inquiry was initiated in the hope of learning what it was that the unfortunate squadron was doing wrong. There was no prior reason to believe that one of the squadrons was more effective than the other, and no operational differences were found,  but of course the lives of the pilots differed in many random ways, including, as I recall, how often they went home between missions and something about the conduct of debriefings. My advice was that the command should accept that the different outcomes were due to blind luck, and that the interviewing of the pilots should stop. I reasoned that luck was the most likely answer, that a random  search for a nonobvious cause was hopeless, and that in the meantime the pilots in the squadron that had sustained losses did not need the extra burden of being made to feel that they and their dead friends were at fault. </p></div>

The “fact” that players  occasionally acquire a hot hand is generally accepted by players, coaches, and fans. The inference is irresistible: a player sinks three or four baskets in a row and you cannot help forming the causal judgment that this player is now hot, with a temporarily increased propensity to score. Players on both teams adapt to this judgment—teammates are more likely to pass to the hot scorer and the defense  is more likely to double-team. Analysis of thousands of sequences of shots led to a disappointing conclusion: there is no such thing as a hot hand in professional basketball, either in shooting from the field or scoring from the foul line. Of course, some players are more accurate than others, but the sequence of successes and missed shots satisfies all tests of randomness. The hot hand is entirely  in  the eye of the beholders, who are consistently too quick to perceive order and causality in randomness.

The example appears in a book intended for statistics teachers, but I learned about it from an amusing article by the two statisticians I quoted earlier, Howard Wainer and Harris Zwerling. Their essay focused on a large investment, some $1.7 billion, which the Gates Foundation made to follow up intriguing findings  on the characteristics of the most successful schools. Many researchers have sought the secret of successful education by identifying the most successful schools in the hope of discovering what distinguishes them from others. One of the conclusions of this research is that the most successful schools, on average, are small. In a survey of 1,662 schools in Pennsylvania, for instance, 6 of the top  50 were small, which is an overrepresentation by a factor of 4. These data encouraged the Gates Foundation to make a substantial investment in the creation of small schools, sometimes by splitting large schools into smaller units. At least half a dozen other prominent institutions, such as the Annenberg Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trust, joined the effort, as did the U.S. Department of Education’s  Smaller Learning Communities Program. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> This probably makes intuitive sense to you. It is easy to construct a causal story that explains how small schools are able to provide superior education and thus produce high-achieving scholars by giving them more personal attention and encouragement than they could get in larger schools.  Unfortunately, the causal analysis is pointless because the facts  are wrong. If the statisticians who reported to the Gates Foundation had asked about the characteristics of the worst schools, they would have found that bad schools also tend to be smaller than average. The truth is that small schools are not better on average; they are simply more variable.

It occurs when people consider a particular value for an unknown quantity before estimating that quantity. What happens is one of the most reliable and robust results of experimental psychology: the estimates stay close to the number that people considered—hence the image of an anchor. If you are asked whether Gandhi was more than 114 years old when he died you will end  up  with a much higher estimate of his age at death than you would if the anchoring question referred to death at 35. If you consider how much you should pay for a house, you will be influenced by the asking price. The same house will appear more valuable if its listing price is high than if it is low, even if you are determined to resist the influence of this number; and so on—the list of anchoring  effects is endless. Any number that you are asked to consider as a possible solution to an estimation problem will induce an anchoring effect. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Amos liked  the idea of an adjust-and-anchor heuristic as a strategy for estimating uncertain quantities: start from an anchoring number, assess whether it is too high or too low, and gradually adjust your estimate by mentally “moving” from the anchor. The adjustment typically ends prematurely, because people stop when they are no longer certain that they should move farther. Decades after our disagreement,  and years after Amos’s death, convincing evidence of such a process was offered independently by two psychologists who had worked closely with Amos early in their careers: Eldar Shafir and Tom Gilovich together with their own students—Amos’s intellectual grandchildren! </p></div>

<p class ="en"> To get the idea, take a sheet of paper and draw a 2½-inch line going up, starting at the bottom of the page—without a ruler.  Now take another sheet, and start at the top and draw a line going down until it is 2½ inches from  the bottom. Compare the lines. There is a good chance that your first estimate of 2½ inches was shorter than the second. The reason is that you do not know exactly what such a line looks like; there is a range of uncertainty. You stop near the bottom of the region of uncertainty when you start from  the bottom of the page and near the top of the region when you start from the top. Robyn Le Boeuf and Shafir found many examples of that mechanism in daily experience. Insufficient adjustment neatly explains why you are likely to drive too fast when you come off the highway onto city streets—especially if you are talking with someone as you drive. Insufficient adjustment is also a source of tension  between exasperated parents and teenagers who enjoy loud music in their room. Le Boeuf and Shafir note that a “well-intentioned child who turns down exceptionally loud music to meet a parent’s demand that it be played at a  ‘reasonable’ volume  may fail to adjust sufficiently from a high anchor, and may feel that genuine attempts at compromise are being overlooked.” The driver and the child both  deliberately adjust down, and both fail to adjust enough. </p></div>

Epley and Gilovich also confirmed that adjustment is an effortful  operation.

You did not believe for a moment that Gandhi  lived for 144 years, but your associative machinery surely generated an impression of a very ancient person. System 1 understands sentences by trying to make them true, and the selective activation of compatible thoughts produces a family of systematic errors that make us gullible and prone to believe too strongly whatever we believe. We can now see why Amos and I did not realize that there were  two types of anchoring: the research techniques  and theoretical ideas we needed did not yet exist. They were developed, much later, by other people. A process that resembles suggestion is indeed at work in many situations: System 1 tries its best to construct a world in which the anchor is the true number. This is one of the manifestations of  associative coherence  that I described in the first  part of the book. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The German psychologists Thomas Mussweiler and Fritz Strack offered the most compelling demonstrations of the role of associative coherence in anchoring. In one experiment, they asked an anchoring question about temperature: “Is the annual mean temperature in Germany higher or lower than 20°C (68°F)?” or “Is the annual mean temperature in Germany higher or lower than 5°C (41°F)?” </p></div>
<div class="top right">

<p class ="en"> All participants were then briefly shown words that they were asked to identify. The researchers found that 68°F made it easier to recognize summer words (like  sun  and  beach ), and 40°F facilitated winter words (like  frost  and  ski ). The selective activation of compatible memories explains anchoring: the high and the low numbers activate different sets of ideas in memory. The estimates of annual  temperature draw on these biased samples of ideas and are therefore biased as well. In another elegant study in the same vein, participants were asked about the average price of German cars. A high anchor selectively primed the names of luxury brands (Mercedes, Audi), whereas the low anchor primed brands associated with mass-market cars (Volkswagen). We saw earlier that any prime will tend to evoke  information that is compatible with it. Suggestion and anchoring are both explained by the same automatic operation of System 1. Although I did not know how to prove it at the time, my hunch about the link between anchoring and suggestion turned out to be correct. </p></div>

In an experiment conducted some years ago, real-estate agents  were given an opportunity to assess the value of a house that was actually on the market. They visited the house and studied a comprehensive booklet of information that included an asking price. Half the agents saw an asking price that was substantially higher than the listed price of the house; the other half saw an asking price that was  substantially lower . Each agent gave her opinion about  a reasonable buying price for the house and the lowest price at which she would agree to sell the house if she owned it. The agents were then asked about the factors that had affected their judgment. Remarkably, the asking price was not one of these factors; the agents took pride in their ability to ignore it.

To demonstrate this effect, we told participants in the Exploratorium study about the environmental damage caused by oil tankers in the Pacific Ocean and asked about their willingness to make an annual contribution “to save 50,000 offshore Pacific Coast seabirds from small offshore oil spills, until  ways are found to prevent spills or require tanker owners to pay for the operation.” This question requires intensity matching: the respondents are asked, in effect, to find the dollar amount of a contribution that matches the intensity of their feelings about the plight of the seabirds.

After all, it is not surprising that people who are asked difficult questions clutch at straws, and the anchor is a plausible straw. If you know next to nothing about the trees of California and are asked whether a redwood can be taller than 1,200 feet, you might infer that this number is not too far from the truth. Somebody who knows the true height thought up that question,  so the anchor may be a valuable hint. However, a key finding of anchoring research is that anchors that are obviously random can be just as effective as potentially informative anchors. When we used a wheel of fortune to anchor estimates of the proportion of African nations in the UN, the anchoring index was 44%, well within the range of effects observed with anchors that could plausibly be taken  as hints. Anchoring effects of similar size have been observed in experiments in which the last few digits of the respondent’s Social Security number was used as the anchor (e.g., for estimating the number of physicians in their city). The conclusion is clear: anchors do not have their effects because people believe they are informative. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Anchoring effects explain why, for example, arbitrary rationing is an effective marketing ploy. A  few years ago, supermarket shoppers in Sioux City, Iowa, encountered a sales promotion for Campbell’s soup at about 10% off the regular price. On some days, a sign on the shelf said  LIMIT OF 12 PER PERSON . On other days, the sign said  NO LIMIT PER PERSON . Shoppers purchased an average of 7 cans when the limit was in force, twice as many as they bought when the limit was removed. Anchoring is not  the sole explanation. Rationing also implies that the goods are flying off the shelves, and shoppers should feel some urgency about stocking up. But we also know that the mention of 12 cans as a possible purchase would produce anchoring even if the number were produced by a roulette wheel. </p></div>

As in many other games, moving first is an advantage in single-issue negotiations—for example, when price is the only issue to be settled between a buyer and a seller. As you may have experienced when negotiating for the first time in a bazaar, the initial anchor has a powerful effect. My advice to students when I taught negotiations was that if you think the  other side has made an outrageous proposal, you should not come back with an equally outrageous counteroffer, creating a gap that will be difficult to bridge in further negotiations. Instead you should make a scene, storm out or threaten to do so, and make it clear—to yourself as well as to the other side—that you will not continue the negotiation with that number on the table. </p></div>

For example, the anchoring effect is reduced or eliminated when the second mover focuses his attention on the minimal offer  that the opponent would accept, or on the costs to the opponent of failing to reach an agreement. In general, a strategy of deliberately “thinking the opposite” may be a good defense against anchoring effects, because it negates the biased recruitment of thoughts that produces these effects. </p></div>

Before you read this chapter you might have thought that capping awards is certainly good for potential defendants, but now you should not be so sure.

Anchoring  effects have always been studied in tasks of judgment and choice that are ultimately completed by System 2. However, System 2 works on data that is retrieved from memory, in an automatic and involuntary operation of System 1. System 2 is therefore susceptible to the biasing influence of anchors that make some information easier to retrieve. Furthermore, System 2 has no control over the effect and  no knowledge of it.

Many others find the results upsetting, because they threaten  the subjective sense of agency and autonomy. If the content of a screen saver on an irrelevant computer can affect your willingness to help strangers without your being aware of it, how free are you? Anchoring effects are threatening in a similar way. You are always aware of the anchor and even pay attention to it, but you do not know how it guides and constrains your thinking, because you  cannot imagine how you would have thought if the anchor had been different (or absent).

We defined the availability heuristic as the process of judging frequency by “ the ease with which  instances come to mind.” The statement seemed clear when we formulated it, but the concept of availability has been refined since then.

<p class ="en"> One of the best-known studies of availability suggests  that awareness of your own biases can contribute to peace in marriages, and probably in other joint projects. In a famous study, spouses were asked, “How large was your personal contribution to keeping the place tidy, in percentages?” They also answered similar questions about “taking out the garbage,” “initiating social engagements,” etc. Would the self-estimated contributions add up to 100%, or  more, or less? As expected, the  self-assessed contributions  added up to more than 100%. The explanation is a simple  availability bias : both spouses remember their own individual efforts and contributions much more clearly than those of the other, and the difference in availability leads to a difference in judged frequency. The bias is not necessarily self-serving: spouses also overestimated their  contribution to causing quarrels, although to a smaller extent than their contributions to more desirable outcomes. The same bias contributes to the common observation that many members of a collaborative team feel they have done more than their share and also feel that the others are not adequately grateful for their individual contributions. </p></div>

The opportunity for successful debiasing exists because the circumstances in which issues of credit allocation come up are easy to identify, the more so because tensions often arise when several people at once feel that their efforts are not adequately recognized. The mere observation that there is usually more than 100% credit to go around  is sometimes sufficient to defuse the situation. In any event, it is a good thing for every individual to remember. You will occasionally do more than your share, but it is useful to know that you are likely to have that feeling even when each member of the team feels the same way. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The ease with which instances of assertiveness come to the subject’s mind changes during the task. The first few instances are easy, but  retrieval soon becomes much harder. Of course, the subject also expects fluency to drop gradually, but the drop of fluency between six and twelve instances appears to be steeper than the participant expected. The results suggest that the participants make an inference: if I am having so much more trouble than expected coming up with instances of my assertiveness, then I can’t be very assertive.  Note that this inference rests on a surprise—fluency being worse than expected. The availability heuristic that the subjects apply is better described as an “unexplained unavailability” heuristic. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Schwarz and his colleagues reasoned that they could disrupt the heuristic by providing the subjects with an explanation for the fluency of  retrieval that they experienced. They told the participants  they would hear background music while recalling instances and that the music would affect performance in the memory task. Some subjects were told that the music would help, others were told to expect diminished fluency. As predicted, participants whose experience of fluency was “explained” did not use it as a heuristic; the subjects who were told that music would make retrieval more difficult rated  themselves as equally assertive when they retrieved twelve instances as when they retrieved six. Other cover stories have been used with the same result: judgments are no longer influenced by ease of retrieval when the experience of fluency is given a spurious explanation by the presence of curved or straight text boxes, by the background color of the screen, or by other irrelevant factors that  the  experimenters dreamed up . </p></div>

<p class ="en"> As I have described it, the process that leads to judgment by availability appears to involve a complex chain of reasoning. The subjects have an experience of diminishing fluency as they produce instances. They evidently have expectations about the rate at which fluency decreases, and those expectations are wrong: the difficulty of coming up with new instances increases  more rapidly than they expect. It is the unexpectedly low fluency that causes people who were asked for twelve instances to describe themselves as unassertive. When the surprise is eliminated, low fluency no longer influences the judgment. The process appears to consist of a sophisticated set of inferences. Is the automatic System 1 capable of it? </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 正如我所描述的，导致可得性判断的过程似乎涉及一个复杂的推理链。受试者在产生实例时有一种流畅性下降的体验。 他们显然对流畅性下降的速度有预期，而这些预期是错误的：想出新实例的难度比他们预期的要快  。正是意外的低流畅性导致被要求提供12个实例的人将自己描述为不自信。当惊喜消除后，低流畅性不再影响判断。 这个过程似乎由一套复杂的推理组成。 自动系统1是否能够做到？ </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> The answer is that in fact no complex reasoning  is needed. Among the basic features of System 1 is its ability to set expectations and to be surprised when these expectations are violated. The system also retrieves possible causes of a surprise, usually by finding a possible cause among recent surprises. Furthermore, System 2 can reset the expectations of System 1 on the fly, so that an event that would normally be surprising is now almost normal.  Suppose you are told that the three-year-old boy who lives next door frequently wears a top hat in his stroller. You will be far less surprised when you actually see him with his top hat than you would have been without the warning. In Schwarz’s experiment, the background music has been mentioned as a possible cause of retrieval problems. The difficulty of retrieving twelve instances is no  longer a surprise and therefore is less likely to be evoked by the task of judging assertiveness. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 答案是，事实上不需要复杂的推理  。在系统1的基本特征中，它能够设定预期，并在这些预期被违反时感到惊讶。该系统还能检索出惊讶的可能原因，通常是在最近的惊讶中找到一个可能的原因。 此外，系统2能够在飞行中重置系统1的预期，因此，一个通常会感到惊讶的事件现在几乎是正常的。  假设有人告诉你，住在隔壁的三岁男孩经常在婴儿车里戴着高帽。当你真正看到他戴着高帽时，你的惊讶程度会远远低于没有警告的情况下。在施瓦茨的实验中，背景音乐被提到是导致检索问题的一个可能原因。 检索12个实例的困难不再是  ，因此不太可能被判断自信的任务所唤起。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Schwarz and his colleagues discovered that people who are personally involved in the judgment are more likely to consider the number of instances they retrieve from memory and less likely to go by fluency. They recruited two groups of students for a study of risks to cardiac health. Half  the students  had a family history of cardiac disease and were expected to take the task more seriously than the others, who had no such history. All were asked to recall either three or eight behaviors in their routine that could  affect their cardiac health  (some were asked for risky behaviors, others for protective behaviors). Students with no family history of heart disease were casual about the task and  followed the availability heuristic. Students who found it difficult to find eight instances of risky behavior felt themselves relatively safe, and those who struggled to retrieve examples of safe behaviors felt themselves at risk. The students with a family history of heart disease showed the opposite pattern—they felt safer when they retrieved many instances of safe behavior and felt greater danger  when they retrieved many instances of risky behavior. They were also more likely to feel that their future behavior would be affected by the experience of evaluating their risk. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Students of risk were quick to see that the idea of availability was relevant to their concerns. Even before our work was published, the economist Howard Kunreuther, who was then in the early stages  of a career that he has devoted to the study of risk and insurance, noticed that availability effects help explain the pattern of insurance purchase and protective action after disasters. Victims and near victims are very concerned after a disaster. After each significant earthquake, Californians are for a while diligent in purchasing insurance and adopting measures of protection and mitigation.  They tie down their boiler to reduce quake damage, seal their basement doors against floods, and maintain emergency supplies in good order. However, the memories of the disaster dim over time, and so do worry and diligence. The dynamics of memory help explain the recurrent cycles of disaster, concern, and growing complacency that are familiar to students of large-scale emergencies. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 研究风险的学生很快就发现，可得性的概念与他们所关注的问题有关。甚至在我们的工作发表之前，经济学家Howard Kunreuther（他当时正处于致力于研究风险和保险的职业生涯的早期阶段  ）就注意到，可得性效应有助于解释购买保险和灾后保护行动的模式。灾难发生后，受害者和接近受害者的人非常担心。每次大地震发生后，加州人都会在一段时间内勤奋地购买保险，并采取保护和减灾措施。  ，他们把锅炉绑起来，以减少地震的破坏，把地下室的门封起来，防止水灾，并保持应急物资的良好状态。然而，对灾难的记忆会随着时间的推移而变淡，担心和勤奋也是如此。记忆的动力有助于解释大规模紧急情况的学生所熟悉的灾难、担忧和日益增长的自满情绪的反复循环。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Kunreuther  also observed that protective actions, whether by individuals or governments, are usually designed to be adequate to the worst disaster actually experienced. As long ago as pharaonic Egypt, societies have tracked the high-water mark of rivers that periodically flood—and have always prepared accordingly, apparently assuming that floods will not rise higher than the existing high-water mark.

<p class ="en"> The most influential studies of availability biases were carried out by our friends in Eugene, where Paul Slovic and his longtime collaborator Sarah Lichtenstein were joined by our former student Baruch Fischhoff. They carried out groundbreaking research on public perceptions of risks, including a survey that has become the  standard example of an availability bias. They asked participants in their survey to consider pairs of causes of death: diabetes and asthma, or stroke and accidents. For each pair, the subjects indicated the more frequent cause and estimated the ratio of the two frequencies. The judgments were compared to health statistics of the time. Here’s a sample of their findings: </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The lesson is clear: estimates of causes of death are warped by media coverage. The coverage is itself biased toward novelty and poignancy. The media do not just shape what the public is interested in, but also are shaped by it. Editors cannot  ignore the public’s demands that certain topics and viewpoints receive extensive coverage. Unusual events (such as botulism) attract disproportionate attention and are consequently perceived as less unusual than they really are. The world in our heads is not a precise replica of reality; our expectations about the frequency of events are distorted by the prevalence and emotional intensity of  the messages to which we are exposed. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 教训很明显：对死亡原因的估计被媒体报道扭曲了。报道本身就偏向于新奇和悲壮。媒体不仅塑造了公众感兴趣的东西，而且也被公众所塑造。编辑们不能  ，忽视公众对某些话题和观点得到广泛报道的要求。不寻常的事件（如肉毒杆菌）吸引了不相称的注意力，因此被认为比实际情况更不寻常。 我们头脑中的世界不是现实的精确复制品；我们对事件发生频率的预期被我们所接触到的信息的普遍性和情感强度所扭曲，  。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> The estimates of causes of death are an almost direct representation of the activation of ideas in associative memory, and are a good example of substitution. But Slovic and his colleagues were led to a deeper insight: they saw that the ease with which ideas of various risks come to mind and the emotional reactions to these risks are inextricably linked.  Frightening  thoughts and images occur to us with particular ease, and thoughts of danger that are fluent and vivid exacerbate fear. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 对死亡原因的估计几乎直接体现了联想记忆中观念的激活，是替代的一个很好的例子。但斯洛维奇和他的同事被引导到一个更深的见解：他们看到，各种风险的观念在脑海中出现的难易程度和对这些风险的情绪反应是密不可分的。  令人恐惧的 思想和图像特别容易发生在我们身上，而对危险的想法如果流畅而生动，就会加剧恐惧。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> As mentioned earlier, Slovic eventually developed the notion of an affect heuristic, in which people make judgments and decisions by consulting their emotions: Do I like it? Do I hate it? How strongly do I feel about it? In many domains of life, Slovic said, people  form opinions and make choices that directly express their feelings and their basic tendency to approach or avoid, often without knowing that they are doing so. The affect heuristic is an instance of substitution, in which the answer to an easy question (How do I feel about it?) serves as an answer to a much harder question (What do I think about it?). Slovic and his colleagues related their views  to the work of the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio, who had proposed that people’s emotional evaluations of outcomes, and the bodily states and the approach and avoidance tendencies associated with them, all play a central role in guiding decision making. Damasio and his colleagues have observed that people who do not display the appropriate emotions before they decide, sometimes  because of brain damage , also have an impaired ability to make good decisions. An inability to be guided by a “healthy fear” of bad consequences is a disastrous flaw. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 如前所述，斯洛维奇最终提出了情感启发式的概念，即人们通过咨询他们的情感来做出判断和决定：我喜欢它吗？我讨厌它吗？我对它的感觉有多强烈？斯洛维奇说，在生活的许多领域，人们  ，形成意见并做出选择，直接表达他们的感受和他们接近或回避的基本倾向，往往不知道他们正在这样做。情感启发式是一个替代的例子，在这个例子中，对一个简单问题（我对它的感觉如何？）的回答可以作为对一个更难的问题（我对它的看法如何？）  斯洛维奇和他的同事将他们的观点与神经科学家安东尼奥-达马西奥（Antonio Damasio）的工作联系起来，他提出人们对结果的情感评价，以及与之相关的身体状态和接近与回避倾向，都在指导决策中发挥着核心作用。达马西奥和他的同事们观察到，那些在做决定前没有表现出适当情绪的人，有时 是因为大脑受损  ，也有做出良好决定的能力受损。无法被对不良后果的 "健康恐惧 "引导是一个灾难性的缺陷。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> In a compelling demonstration of the workings of the affect heuristic, Slovic’s research team surveyed opinions about various technologies, including water fluoridation, chemical plants, food preservatives, and cars, and asked their respondents to list  both the benefits and the  risks of each technology . They observed an implausibly high negative correlation between two estimates that their respondents made: the level of benefit and the level of risk that they attributed to the technologies. When people were favorably disposed toward a technology, they rated it as offering large benefits and imposing little risk; when they disliked a technology,  they could think only of its disadvantages, and few advantages came to mind. Because the technologies lined up neatly from good to bad, no painful tradeoffs needed to be faced. Estimates of risk and benefit corresponded even more closely when people rated risks and benefits under time pressure. Remarkably, members of the  British Toxicology Society  responded similarly: they found little benefit  in substances or technologies that they thought risky, and vice versa. Consistent affect is a central element of what I have called associative coherence. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在一个令人信服的影响启发式运作的演示中，斯洛维奇的研究小组调查了关于各种技术的意见，包括氟化水、化工厂、食品防腐剂和汽车，并要求他们的受访者列出 每项技术的 好处和 风险  。他们观察到受访者做出的两个估计之间存在令人难以置信的高度负相关：他们认为这些技术的好处和风险水平。当人们对某项技术有好感时，他们认为它能提供巨大的利益，而且风险很小；当他们不喜欢某项技术时，  ，他们只能想到它的缺点，而很少想到优点。因为这些技术从好到坏整齐地排列着，不需要面对痛苦的权衡。当人们在时间压力下对风险和益处进行评价时，风险和益处的估计甚至更加接近。 值得注意的是， 英国毒理学会 的成员也做出了类似的反应：他们发现在他们认为有风险的物质或技术中几乎没有益处  ，反之亦然。一致的情感是我所称的联想一致性的一个核心要素。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> The best part of the experiment came next. After completing the initial survey, the respondents read brief passages with arguments in favor of various technologies. Some were given arguments that focused on the numerous benefits of a technology;  others, arguments that stressed the low  risks. These messages were effective in changing the emotional appeal of the technologies. The striking finding was that people who had received a message extolling the benefits of a technology also changed their beliefs about its risks. Although they had received no relevant evidence, the technology they now liked more than before was also perceived as  less risky. Similarly, respondents who were told only that the risks of a technology were mild developed a more favorable view of its benefits. The implication is clear: as the psychologist Jonathan Haidt said in another context, “The emotional tail  wags the rational dog .” The affect heuristic simplifies our lives by creating a world that is much tidier than reality. Good technologies have few  costs in the imaginary world we inhabit, bad technologies have no benefits, and all decisions are easy. In the real world, of course, we often face painful tradeoffs between benefits and costs. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 实验最精彩的部分在接下来。 在完成最初的调查后，受访者阅读了支持各种技术的简短论据。一些人得到的论据侧重于某项技术的众多好处；  ，其他的论据则强调 的低风险。这些信息有效地改变了技术的情感吸引力。 引人注目的发现是，那些收到赞美技术好处的信息的人也改变了他们对技术风险的看法。 尽管他们没有收到相关的证据，但他们现在比以前更喜欢的技术也被认为是  ，风险更低。同样，那些只被告知某项技术的风险较小的受访者，对其利益产生了更有利的看法。 其含义很清楚：正如心理学家乔纳森-海特在另一种情况下所说的，"情感的尾巴 摇动着理性的狗 。"影响启发式通过创造一个比现实更整洁的世界来简化我们的生活。在我们居住的假想世界中，好的技术几乎没有  ，坏的技术没有好处，所有的决定都很容易。当然，在现实世界中，我们经常面临利益和成本之间痛苦的权衡。 </p></div>

His work offers a picture of Mr. and Ms. Citizen that is far from  flattering: guided by emotion rather than by reason, easily swayed by trivial details, and inadequately sensitive to differences between low and negligibly low probabilities. Slovic has also studied experts, who are clearly superior in dealing with numbers and amounts. Experts show many of the same biases as the rest of us in attenuated form, but often their judgments and preferences about risks  diverge from those of other people. </p></div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Differences between experts and the public are explained in part by biases in lay judgments, but Slovic draws attention to situations in which the differences reflect a genuine conflict of values. He points out that experts often measure risks by the number of lives (or life-years) lost, while the public draws finer distinctions, for example between “good deaths”  and “bad deaths,” or between random accidental fatalities and deaths that occur in the course of voluntary activities such as skiing. These legitimate distinctions are often ignored in statistics that merely count cases. Slovic argues from such observations that the public has a richer conception of risks than the experts do. Consequently, he strongly resists the view that the experts should  rule, and that their opinions should be accepted without question when they conflict with the opinions and wishes of other citizens. When experts and the public disagree on their priorities, he says, “Each side must respect the insights and intelligence of the other.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 专家和公众之间的差异部分地被解释为非专业判断中的偏见，但斯洛维奇提请注意这些差异反映了真正的价值观冲突的情况。他指出，专家们通常用失去的生命（或生命年）的数量来衡量风险，而公众则有更精细的区分，例如 "好的死亡 "  和 "坏的死亡"，或随机的意外死亡和在自愿活动（如滑雪）过程中发生的死亡。这些合理的区别往往在仅仅计算案例的统计中被忽视。 斯洛维奇根据这些观察认为，公众比专家有更丰富的风险概念。 因此，他强烈反对专家应该  ，当他们的意见与其他公民的意见和愿望相冲突时，应该毫无疑义地接受。 他说，当专家和公众在他们的优先事项上有分歧时，"双方都必须尊重对方的见解和智慧。" </p></div>

<p class ="en"> To illustrate his claim, Slovic lists nine ways  of defining the mortality risk associated with the release of a toxic material into the air, ranging from “death per million people” to “death per million dollars of product produced.” His point is that the evaluation of the risk depends on the choice of a measure—with the obvious possibility that the choice may have been guided by a preference for one outcome or another. He goes on to conclude that  “defining risk is thus an exercise in power.” You might not have guessed that one can get to such thorny policy issues from experimental studies of the psychology of judgment! However, policy is ultimately about people, what they want and what is best for them. Every policy question involves assumptions about human nature, in particular about the choices that people may make and the consequences  of their choices for themselves and for society. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Another scholar and friend whom I greatly admire, Cass Sunstein, disagrees sharply with Slovic’s stance on the different views of experts and citizens, and defends the role of experts as a bulwark against “populist” excesses. Sunstein is one of the foremost legal scholars in the United States, and shares with other leaders of his profession the  attribute of intellectual fearlessness. He knows he can master any body of knowledge quickly and thoroughly, and he has mastered many, including both the psychology of judgment and choice and issues of regulation and risk policy. His view is that the existing system of regulation in the United States displays a very poor setting of priorities, which reflects reaction to public pressures more than  careful objective analysis. He starts from the position that risk regulation and government intervention to reduce risks should be guided by rational weighting of costs and benefits, and that the natural units for this analysis are the number of lives saved (or perhaps the number of life-years saved, which gives more weight to saving the young) and the dollar cost to the economy. Poor regulation  is wasteful of lives and money, both of which can be measured objectively. Sunstein has not been persuaded by Slovic’s  argument that risk and its measurement is subjective. Many aspects of risk assessment are debatable, but he has faith in the objectivity that may be achieved by science, expertise, and careful deliberation. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> An availability  cascade is a self-sustaining chain of events, which may start from media reports of a relatively minor event and lead up to public panic and large-scale government action. On some occasions, a media story about a risk catches the attention of a segment of the public, which becomes aroused and worried. This emotional reaction becomes a story in itself, prompting additional coverage in the media,  which in turn produces greater concern and involvement. The cycle is sometimes sped along deliberately by “availability entrepreneurs,” individuals or organizations who work to ensure a continuous flow of worrying news. The danger is increasingly exaggerated as the media compete for attention-grabbing headlines. Scientists and others who try to dampen the increasing fear and revulsion attract little  attention, most of it hostile: anyone who claims that the danger is overstated is suspected of association with a “heinous cover-up.” The issue becomes politically important because it is on everyone’s mind, and the response of the political system is guided by the intensity of public sentiment. The availability cascade has now reset priorities. Other risks, and other ways that resources could  be applied for the public good, all have faded into the background. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Kuran and Sunstein focused on two examples that are still controversial: the Love Canal affair and the so-called Alar scare. In Love Canal, buried toxic waste was exposed during a rainy season in 1979, causing contamination of the water well beyond standard limits, as well as a foul smell. The residents of the community were  angry and frightened, and one of them,  Lois Gibbs, was particularly active in an attempt to sustain interest in the problem. The availability cascade unfolded according to the standard script. At its peak there were daily stories about Love Canal, scientists attempting to claim that the dangers were overstated were ignored or shouted down, ABC News aired a program titled  The Killing Ground , and  empty baby-size coffins were paraded in front of the legislature. A large number of residents were relocated at government expense, and the control of toxic waste became the major environmental issue of the 1980s. The legislation that mandated the cleanup of toxic sites, called CERCLA, established a Superfund and is considered a significant achievement of environmental legislation. It was also expensive,  and some have claimed that the same amount of money could have saved many more lives if it had been directed to other priorities. Opinions about what actually happened at Love Canal are still sharply divided, and claims of actual damage to health appear not to have been substantiated. Kuran and Sunstein wrote up the Love Canal story almost as a pseudo-event, while on the other side of the  debate, environmentalists still speak of the “Love Canal disaster.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> Kuran和Sunstein集中讨论了两个仍有争议的例子：爱运河事件和所谓的阿拉尔恐慌。 在爱运河事件中，埋藏的有毒废物在1979年的一个雨季被暴露出来，导致水的污染远远超过标准限度，并产生恶臭。社区的居民们  ，感到愤怒和恐惧，其中一个人， Lois Gibbs，特别积极地试图维持对这个问题的兴趣。可用性级联按照标准脚本展开。在它的高峰期，每天都有关于爱情运河的故事，试图声称危险被夸大的科学家被忽视或喊停，ABC新闻播出了一个名为 《杀戮之地》 的节目，  ，空的婴儿大小的棺材在立法机构前被游行。大量的居民由政府出资重新安置，有毒废物的控制成为80年代的主要环境问题。授权清理有毒场地的立法，称为CERCLA，建立了超级基金，被认为是环境立法的重大成就。它也很昂贵，  ，一些人声称，如果把同样的钱用于其他优先事项，可以拯救更多的生命。关于爱运河实际发生的事情，人们的意见仍有很大分歧，关于对健康造成实际损害的说法似乎没有得到证实。 库兰和桑斯坦把爱运河的故事几乎写成了一个伪事件，而在  ，环保主义者仍在谈论 "爱运河灾难"。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Opinions are also divided on the second example Kuran and Sunstein used to illustrate their concept of an availability cascade, the Alar incident, known to detractors of environmental concerns as the “Alar scare” of 1989. Alar is a chemical that was sprayed on apples to regulate their growth and improve their appearance. The  scare began with press stories that the chemical, when consumed in gigantic doses, caused cancerous tumors in rats and mice. The stories understandably frightened the public, and those fears encouraged more media coverage, the basic mechanism of an availability cascade. The topic dominated the news and produced dramatic media events such as the testimony of the actress Meryl Streep before Congress.  The apple industry sustained large losses as apples and apple products became objects of fear. Kuran and Sunstein quote a citizen who called in to ask “whether it was safer to pour apple juice down the drain or to take it to a toxic waste dump.” The manufacturer withdrew the product and the FDA banned it. Subsequent research confirmed that the substance might pose a very small risk as a possible  carcinogen, but the Alar incident was certainly an enormous overreaction to a minor problem. The net effect of the incident on public health was probably detrimental because fewer good apples were consumed. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 对于Kuran和Sunstein用来说明他们的可用性级联概念的第二个例子，即Alar事件，被环境问题的诋毁者称为1989年的 "Alar恐慌"，也存在意见分歧。Alar是一种化学品，被喷洒在苹果上以调节其生长并改善其外观。  恐慌始于新闻报道，即这种化学品在以巨大的剂量食用时，会在大鼠和小鼠身上引起癌症肿瘤。可以理解的是，这些故事让公众感到恐惧，而这些恐惧鼓励了更多的媒体报道，这就是可用性级联的基本机制。这个话题主导了新闻，并产生了戏剧性的媒体事件，如女演员梅丽尔-斯特里普在国会作证。  由于苹果和苹果产品成为恐惧的对象，苹果行业蒙受了巨大的损失。 库兰和桑斯坦引用了一位市民的电话，询问 "是把苹果汁倒进下水道还是把它送到有毒废物堆里更安全"。制造商撤回了该产品，美国食品和药物管理局禁止了该产品。随后的研究证实，该物质作为一种可能的  致癌物，可能构成非常小的风险，但Alar事件无疑是对一个小问题的巨大过度反应。该事件对公众健康的净影响可能是有害的，因为被消费的好苹果更少。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The Alar tale illustrates a basic limitation in the ability of our mind to deal with small risks: we either ignore them altogether or give them far too much weight— nothing in between . Every  parent who has stayed up waiting  for a teenage daughter who is late from a party will recognize the feeling. You may know that there is really (almost) nothing to worry about, but you cannot help images of disaster from coming to mind. As Slovic has argued, the amount of concern is not adequately sensitive to the probability of harm; you are imagining the numerator—the tragic story you saw on  the news—and not thinking about the denominator. Sunstein has coined the phrase “probability neglect” to describe the pattern. The combination of probability neglect with the social mechanisms of availability cascades inevitably leads to gross exaggeration of minor threats, sometimes with important consequences. </p></div>

With a few horrible exceptions such as 9/11, the number of casualties from terror attacks is very small relative to other causes of death. Even in countries that have been targets of intensive terror campaigns, such as Israel, the weekly number of casualties almost never came close to the number of traffic deaths. The difference is in the availability of the two risks,  the ease and the frequency with which they come to mind. Gruesome images, endlessly repeated in the media, cause everyone to be on edge. As I know from experience, it is difficult to reason oneself into a state of complete calm. Terrorism speaks directly to System 1. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Where do I come down in the debate between my friends? Availability cascades are real and they undoubtedly distort priorities in  the allocation of public resources. Cass Sunstein would seek mechanisms that insulate decision makers from public pressures, letting the allocation of resources be determined by impartial experts who have a broad view of all risks and of the resources available to reduce them. Paul Slovic trusts the experts much less and the public somewhat more than Sunstein does, and he points out that insulating  the experts from the emotions of the public produces policies that the public will reject—an impossible situation in a democracy. Both are eminently sensible, and I agree with both. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在我的朋友之间的辩论中，我的立场是什么？可用性级联是真实存在的，它们无疑扭曲了  公共资源分配的优先次序。 Cass Sunstein将寻求使决策者免受公众压力的机制，让资源分配由公正的专家决定，他们对所有风险和可用于减少风险的资源有广泛的看法。保罗-斯洛维奇比孙斯坦更不信任专家，而更信任公众，他指出，将专家与公众的情绪隔绝  ，会产生公众会拒绝的政策--这在民主制度中是不可能的情况。两者都是非常明智的，我也同意两者。 </p></div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> I share Sunstein’s discomfort with the influence of irrational fears and availability cascades on public policy in the domain of risk. However, I also share Slovic’s belief that widespread fears, even if they are  unreasonable, should not be ignored by policy makers. Rational or not, fear is painful and debilitating, and policy makers must endeavor to protect the public from fear, not only from real dangers. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 我和Sunstein一样，对非理性的恐惧和可得性连带对风险领域的公共政策的影响感到不安。 然而，我也和Slovic一样认为，广泛的恐惧，即使它们是  不合理的，也不应该被政策制定者忽视。无论理性与否，恐惧都是痛苦和衰弱的，政策制定者必须努力保护公众免受恐惧，而不仅仅是免受真正的危险。 </p></div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Slovic rightly stresses the resistance of the public to the idea of decisions being made by unelected and unaccountable experts. Furthermore, availability cascades may have a long-term benefit by calling  attention to classes  of risks and by increasing the overall size of the risk-reduction budget. The Love Canal incident may have caused excessive resources to be allocated to the management of toxic waste, but it also had a more general effect in raising the priority level of environmental concerns. Democracy is inevitably messy, in part because the availability and affect heuristics that guide  citizens’ beliefs and attitudes are inevitably biased, even if they generally point in the right direction. Psychology should inform the design of risk policies that combine the experts’ knowledge with the public’s emotions and intuitions. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 斯洛维奇正确地强调了公众对由未经选举和不负责任的专家作出决定的想法的抵制。此外，可用性级联可能有一个长期的好处，即呼吁  注意风险的类 ，并增加减少风险预算的总体规模。爱情运河事件可能导致了过多的资源被分配到有毒废物的管理上，但它也在提高环境问题的优先级方面产生了更普遍的影响。 民主不可避免地是混乱的，部分原因是指导  公民的信念和态度的可用性和影响启发式方法不可避免地有偏见，即使它们通常指向正确的方向。心理学应该为设计风险政策提供信息，将专家的知识与公众的情感和直觉相结合。 </p></div>

So far as you know, Tom W was picked at random from the graduate students at the university, like a single marble drawn from an urn. To decide whether a marble is more likely to be red or green, you need to know how many marbles of each color  there are in the urn. The proportion of marbles of a particular kind is called a  base rate . Similarly, the base rate of humanities and education in this  problem is the proportion of students of that field among all the graduate students. In the absence of specific information about Tom W, you will go by the base rates and guess that he is more likely to be enrolled in humanities and education than in computer science or library science, because there are more students overall in the humanities and education than in the other two fields. Using base-rate  information is the obvious move when no other information is provided. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Amos and I worked hard during the year we spent in Eugene, and I sometimes stayed in the office through the night. One of my tasks for such a night was to make up a description that would pit representativeness and base rates against each other. Tom W was the result of my efforts, and I completed the description  in the early morning hours. The first person who showed up to work that morning was our colleague and friend Robyn Dawes, who was both a sophisticated statistician and a skeptic about the validity of intuitive judgment. If anyone would see the relevance of the base rate, it would have to be Robyn. I called Robyn over, gave him the question I had just typed, and asked him to guess Tom W’s  profession. I still remember his sly smile as he said tentatively, “computer scientist?” That was a happy moment—even the mighty had fallen. Of course, Robyn immediately recognized his mistake as soon as I mentioned “base rate,” but he had not spontaneously thought of it. Although he knew as much as anyone about the role of base rates in prediction, he neglected them when presented with the description  of an individual’s personality. As expected, he substituted a judgment of representativeness for the probability he was asked to assess. </p></div>

They did not disappoint us. Their rankings of the nine fields by probability did  not differ from ratings by similarity to the stereotype. Substitution was perfect in this case: there was no indication that the participants did anything else but judge representativeness. The question about probability (likelihood) was difficult, but the question about similarity was easier, and it was answered instead. This is a serious mistake,  because judgments of similarity and probability  are not constrained by the same logical rules. It is entirely acceptable for judgments of similarity to be unaffected by base rates and also by the possibility that the description was inaccurate, but anyone who ignores base rates and the quality of evidence in probability assessments will certainly make mistakes. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Logicians and statisticians have developed competing definitions of probability, all very precise. For laypeople, however, probability (a synonym of  likelihood  in everyday language) is a vague notion, related to uncertainty, propensity, plausibility, and surprise. The vagueness  is not particular to this concept, nor is it especially troublesome. We know, more or less, what we mean when we use a word such as  democracy  or  beauty  and the people we are talking to understand, more or less, what we intended to say. In all the years I spent asking questions about the probability of events, no one ever raised a hand to ask me, “Sir, what do you mean by probability?” as they  would have done if I had asked them to assess a strange concept such as globability. Everyone acted as if they knew how to answer my questions, although we all understood that it would be unfair to ask them for an explanation of what the word means. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> People who are asked to assess probability are not stumped, because they do not try to judge probability as statisticians and philosophers use the  word. A question about probability or likelihood activates a mental shotgun, evoking answers to easier questions. One of the easy answers is an automatic assessment of representativeness—routine in understanding language. The (false) statement that “Elvis Presley’s parents wanted him to be a dentist” is mildly funny because the discrepancy between the images of Presley and a dentist is detected  automatically. System 1 generates an impression of similarity without intending to do so. The representativeness heuristic is involved when someone says “She will win the election; you can see she is a winner” or “He won’t go far as an academic; too many tattoos.” We rely on representativeness when we judge the potential leadership of a candidate for office by the shape of his chin or the forcefulness  of his speeches. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Although it is common, prediction by representativeness is not statistically  optimal. Michael Lewis’s bestselling  Moneyball  is a story about the inefficiency of this mode of prediction. Professional baseball scouts traditionally forecast the success of possible players in part by their build and look. The hero of Lewis’s book is Billy Beane, the manager of the Oakland A’s, who  made the unpopular decision to overrule his scouts and to select players by the statistics of past performance. The players the A’s picked were inexpensive, because other teams had rejected them for not looking the part. The team soon achieved excellent results at low cost. </p></div>

Frowning, as we have seen, generally increases the vigilance of System 2 and reduces both overconfidence and the reliance on intuition. The students  who puffed out their cheeks (an emotionally neutral expression) replicated the original results: they relied exclusively on representativeness and ignored the base rates.

<p class ="en"> The relevant “rules” for cases such as the Tom  W problem are provided by Bayesian statistics. This influential modern approach to statistics is named after an English minister of the eighteenth century, the Reverend Thomas Bayes, who is credited with the first major contribution to a large problem: the logic of how people should change their mind in the light of evidence.  Bayes’s rule  specifies how prior beliefs (in the examples of this chapter,  base rates) should be combined with the diagnosticity of the evidence, the degree to which it favors the hypothesis over the alternative. For example, if you believe that 3% of graduate students are enrolled in computer science (the base rate), and you also believe that the description of Tom W is 4 times more likely for a graduate student in that field than in other fields, then Bayes’s rule  says you must believe that the probability that Tom W is a computer scientist is now 11%. If the base rate had been 80%, the new degree of belief would be 94.1%. And so on. </p></div>

The difference is instructive. The longer version separated the two critical outcomes by an intervening item (insurance salesperson), and the readers judged each outcome independently, without comparing them.

Imagine that a large number of people are instructed to sort themselves into groups in a room: “Those whose names begin  with the letters  A  to  L  are told to gather in the front left corner.” They are then instructed to sort themselves further. The relation of inclusion is now obvious, and you can see that individuals whose name begins with  C  will be a subset of the crowd in the front left corner. In the medical survey question, heart attack victims end up in a corner of the room, and some of them are less than 55  years old. Not everyone will share this particular vivid imagery, but many subsequent experiments have shown that the frequency representation, as it is known, makes it easy to appreciate that one group is wholly included in the other. The solution to the puzzle appears to be that a question phrased as “how many?” makes you think of individuals, but the same question phrased as “what percentage?”  does not. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> What have we learned from these studies about the workings of System  2? One conclusion, which is not new, is that System 2 is not impressively alert. The undergraduates and graduate students who participated in our studies of the conjunction fallacy certainly “knew” the logic of Venn diagrams, but they did not apply it reliably even when all the relevant information was laid out in  front of them. The absurdity of the less-is-more pattern was obvious in Hsee’s dinnerware study and was easily recognized in the “how many?” representation, but it was not apparent to the thousands of people who have committed the conjunction fallacy in the original Linda problem and in others like it. In all these cases, the conjunction appeared plausible, and that sufficed for an endorsement of  System 2. </p></div>

This reasoning neglects the unique feature of the conjunction fallacy as a case of conflict  between intuition and logic. The evidence that we had built up for heuristics from between-subjects experiment (including studies of Linda) was not challenged—it was simply not addressed, and its salience was diminished by the exclusive focus on the conjunction fallacy. The net effect of the Linda problem was an increase in the visibility of our work to the general public, and a small dent in  the credibility of our approach among scholars in the field.

One of the basic characteristics of System 1 is that it represents categories as norms and prototypical exemplars. This is how we think of horses, refrigerators, and New York police officers; we hold in memory a representation of one or more “normal” members of each of these categories. When the  categories are social, these representations are called stereotypes. Some stereotypes are perniciously wrong, and hostile stereotyping can have dreadful  consequences, but the psychological facts cannot be avoided: stereotypes, both correct and false, are how we think of categories. </p></div>

In sensitive social contexts, we do not want to draw possibly erroneous conclusions  about the individual from the statistics of the group.

In his experiment, Ajzen showed his participants brief vignettes describing some students who had taken an exam at Yale and asked the participants to judge the probability that each student had passed the test. The manipulation of causal base rates was straightforward: Ajzen told one group that the students they saw had been drawn from a class in which 75% passed the exam, and told another group  that the same students had been in a class in which only 25% passed. This is a powerful manipulation, because the base rate of passing suggests the immediate inference that the test that only 25% passed must have been brutally difficult. The difficulty of a test is, of course, one of the causal factors that determine every  student’s outcome. As expected, Ajzen’s subjects were highly sensitive  to the causal base rates, and every student was judged more likely to pass in the high-success condition than in the high-failure rate. </p></div>

They told students about the renowned “helping experiment” that had been conducted a few years earlier at New York University. Participants  in that experiment were  led to individual booths and invited to speak over the intercom about their personal lives and problems. They were to talk in turn for about two minutes. Only one microphone was active at any one time. There were six participants in each group, one of whom was a stooge. The stooge spoke first, following a script prepared by the experimenters. He described his problems adjusting to New York and admitted  with obvious embarrassment that he was prone to seizures, especially when stressed. All the participants then had a turn. When the microphone was again turned over to the stooge, he became agitated and incoherent, said he felt a seizure coming on, and asked for someone to help him. The last words heard from him were, “C-could somebody-er-er-help-er-uh-uh-uh [choking sounds]. I … I’m gonna die-er-er-er  I’m … gonna die-er-er-I seizure I-er [chokes, then quiet].” At this point the microphone of the next participant automatically became active, and nothing more was heard from the possibly dying individual. </p></div>

The interviewees appeared to be nice, normal, decent people. They described their hobbies, their spare-time activities, and their plans for the future, which were entirely conventional.

This question is answered by consulting the base rate. We have been told that  only 4 of the 15 participants in the experiment rushed to help after the first request. The probability that an unidentified participant had been immediately helpful is therefore 27%. Thus your prior belief about any unspecified participant should be that he did not rush to help. Next, Bayesian logic requires you to adjust your judgment in light of any relevant information about the individual.  However, the videos were carefully designed to be uninformative; they provided no reason to suspect that the individuals would be either more or less helpful than a randomly chosen student.

When we teach our students about the behavior of people in the  helping experiment, we expect them to learn something they had not known before; we wish to change how they think about people’s behavior in a particular situation. This goal was not accomplished in the Nisbett-Borgida study, and there is no reason to believe that the results would have been different if they had chosen another surprising psychological experiment. Indeed, Nisbett and Borgida reported  similar findings in teaching another study, in which mild social pressure caused people to accept much more painful electric shocks than most of us (and them) would have expected. Students who do not develop a new appreciation for the power of social setting have learned nothing of value from the experiment. The predictions they make about random strangers, or about their own behavior, indicate  that they have not changed their view of how they would have behaved. In the words of Nisbett and Borgida, students “quietly exempt themselves” (and their friends and acquaintances) from the conclusions of experiments that surprise them. Teachers of psychology should not despair, however, because Nisbett and Borgida report a way to make their students appreciate the point of the helping experiment.  They took a new group of students and taught them the procedure of the experiment but did not tell them the group results. They showed the two videos and simply told their students that the two individuals they had just seen had not helped the stranger, then asked them to guess the global results.

<p class ="en"> This is a profoundly important conclusion. People who are taught surprising statistical facts about human behavior may be impressed to the point of telling  their friends about what they have heard, but this does not mean that their understanding of the world has really changed. The test of learning psychology is whether your understanding of situations you encounter has changed, not whether you have learned a new fact. There is a deep gap between our thinking about statistics and our thinking about individual cases. Statistical results with a causal  interpretation have a stronger effect on our thinking than noncausal information. But even compelling causal statistics will not change long-held beliefs or beliefs rooted in personal experience. On the other hand, surprising individual cases have a powerful impact and are a more effective tool for teaching psychology because the incongruity must be resolved and embedded in a causal story. That is  why this book contains questions that are addressed personally to the reader. You are more likely to learn something by finding surprises in your own behavior than by hearing surprising facts about people in general. </p></div>

This is what he said: “On many occasions I have praised flight cadets for clean execution of some aerobatic maneuver. The next time they try the same maneuver they usually do worse. On the other hand, I have often screamed into a cadet’s earphone for bad execution, and in general he does better on his next  try. So please don’t tell us that reward works and punishment does not, because the opposite is the case.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> This was a joyous moment of insight, when I saw in a new light a principle of statistics that I had been teaching for years. The instructor was right—but he was also completely wrong! His observation was astute and correct: occasions on which he praised a performance were likely to be followed  by a disappointing performance, and punishments were typically followed by an improvement. But the inference he had drawn about the efficacy of reward and punishment was completely off the mark. What he had  observed is known as  regression to the mean , which in that case was due to random fluctuations in the quality of performance. Naturally, he praised only a cadet whose performance was far better  than average. But the cadet was probably just lucky on that particular attempt and therefore likely to deteriorate regardless of whether or not he was praised. Similarly, the instructor would shout into a cadet’s earphones only when the cadet’s performance was unusually bad and therefore likely to improve regardless of what the instructor did. The instructor had attached a causal interpretation  to the inevitable fluctuations of a random process. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The challenge called for a response, but a lesson in the algebra of prediction would not be enthusiastically received. Instead, I used chalk to mark a target on the floor. I asked every officer in the room to turn his back to the target and throw two coins at it in immediate succession, without looking. We measured the distances from the target  and wrote the two results of each contestant on the blackboard. Then we rewrote the results in order, from the best to the worst performance on the first try. It was apparent that most (but not all) of those who had done best the first time deteriorated on their second try, and those who had done poorly on the first attempt generally improved. I pointed out to the instructors that what they saw  on the board coincided with what we had heard about the performance of aerobatic maneuvers on successive attempts: poor performance was typically followed by improvement and good performance by deterioration, without any help from either praise or punishment. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The discovery I made on that day was that the flight instructors were trapped in an unfortunate contingency: because they punished cadets  when performance was poor, they were mostly rewarded by a subsequent improvement, even if punishment was actually ineffective. Furthermore, the instructors were not alone in that predicament. I had stumbled onto a significant fact of the human condition: the feedback to which life exposes us is perverse. Because we tend to be nice to other people when they please us and nasty when they do not,  we are statistically punished for being nice and rewarded for being nasty. </p></div>

To keep things simple, assume that on both days the average score of the competitors was at par 72. We focus on a player who did very well on the first day, closing with a score of 66. What can we learn from that excellent score? An immediate inference is that the golfer is more talented than the average  participant in the tournament. The formula for success suggests that another inference is equally justified: the golfer who did so well on day 1 probably enjoyed better-than-average luck on that day. If you accept that talent and luck both contribute to success, the conclusion that the successful golfer was lucky is as warranted as the conclusion that he is talented. </p></div>

Each athlete has two jumps in the event, and the results are combined for the final score. I was startled to hear the sportscaster’s comments while athletes were preparing for their second jump: “Norway had a great first jump; he will be tense, hoping to protect his lead and will probably do worse” or “Sweden  had a bad first jump and now he knows he has nothing to lose and will be relaxed, which should help him do better.” The commentator had obviously detected regression to the mean and had invented a causal story for which there was no evidence. The story itself could even be true. Perhaps if we measured the athletes’ pulse before each jump we might find that they are indeed more relaxed after a bad  first jump. And perhaps not. The point to remember is that the change from the first to the second jump does not need a causal explanation. It is a mathematically inevitable consequence of the fact that luck played a role in the outcome of the first jump.

Regression effects can be found wherever we look, but we do not recognize them for what they are. They hide in plain sight.

<p class ="en"> You probably sympathize with Galton’s struggle with the concept of regression. Indeed, the statistician David Freedman used to say that if the topic of regression  comes up in a criminal or civil trial, the side that must explain regression to the jury will lose the case. Why is it so hard? The main reason for the difficulty is a recurrent theme of this book: our mind is strongly biased toward causal explanations and does not deal well with “mere statistics.” When our attention is called to an event, associative memory will look for its cause—more precisely,  activation will automatically spread to any cause that is already stored in memory. Causal explanations will be evoked when regression is detected, but they will be wrong because the truth is that regression to the mean has an explanation but does not have a cause. The event that attracts our attention in the golfing tournament is the frequent deterioration of the performance of the golfers  who were successful on day 1. The best explanation of it is that those golfers were unusually lucky that day, but this explanation lacks the causal force that our minds prefer. Indeed, we pay people quite well to provide interesting explanations of regression effects. A business commentator who correctly announces that “the business did better this year because it had done poorly last year” is  likely to have a short tenure on the air. </p></div>

It is also the case that depressed children  who spend some time standing on their head or hug a cat for twenty minutes a day will also show improvement. Most readers of such headlines will automatically infer that the energy drink or the cat hugging caused an improvement, but this conclusion is completely unjustified. Depressed children are an extreme group, they are more depressed than most other children—and extreme groups regress  to the mean over time. The correlation between depression scores on successive occasions of testing is less than perfect, so there will be regression to the mean: depressed children will get somewhat better over time even if they hug no cats and drink no Red Bull. In order to conclude that an energy drink—or any other treatment—is effective, you must compare a group of patients who receive this treatment  to a “control group” that receives no treatment (or, better, receives a placebo). The control group is expected to improve by regression alone, and the aim of the experiment is to determine whether the treated patients improve more than regression can explain. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The objective of this study was to compare the percentile judgments that the participants made when evaluating the evidence in one case, and when predicting the ultimate outcome in another. The results are easy to summarize: the judgments were identical. Although the two sets of questions differ (one is about the description, the other about the student’s future  academic performance), the participants treated them as if they were the same. As was the case with Julie, the prediction of the future is not distinguished from an evaluation of current evidence—prediction matches evaluation. This is perhaps the best evidence we have for the role of substitution. People are asked for a prediction but they substitute an evaluation of the evidence, without noticing  that the question they answer is not the one they were asked. This process is guaranteed to generate predictions that are systematically biased; they completely ignore regression to the mean. </p></div>

The designated  criterion for  successful prediction was a cadet’s final grade in officer school. The validity of the ratings was known to be rather poor (I will tell more about it in a later chapter). The unit still existed years later, when I was a professor and collaborating with Amos in the study of intuitive judgment. I had good contacts with the people at the unit and asked them for a favor. In addition  to the usual grading system they used to evaluate the candidates, I asked for their best guess of the grade that each of the future cadets would obtain in officer school. They collected a few hundred such forecasts. The officers who had produced the predictions were all familiar with the letter grading system that the school applied to its cadets and the approximate proportions of A’s, B’s, etc.,  among them. The results were striking: the relative frequency of A’s and B’s in the predictions was almost identical to the frequencies in the final grades of the school. </p></div>

In the absence of information, you would have predicted the average. (This is similar to assigning the base-rate probability of business  administration graduates when you are told nothing about Tom W.) Step 2 is your intuitive prediction, which matches your evaluation of the evidence. Step 3 moves you from the baseline toward your intuition, but the distance you are allowed to move depends on your estimate of the correlation. You end up, at step 4, with a prediction that is influenced by your intuition but is  far more moderate . </p></div>

<p class ="en"> This approach to prediction is general. You can apply it whenever you need to predict a quantitative variable, such as GPA, profit from an investment, or the growth of a company. The approach builds on your intuition, but it moderates it, regresses it toward the mean. When you have good reasons to trust the accuracy of your intuitive prediction—a strong correlation between the evidence and the prediction—the  adjustment will be small. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 这种预测的方法是普遍的。只要你需要预测一个量化的变量，如GPA、投资利润或公司的增长，你都可以应用它。该方法建立在你的直觉之上，但它会对其进行调节，使其向平均值回归。当你有充分的理由相信你的直觉预测的准确性--证据和预测之间有很强的相关性--  ，调整会很小。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Intuitive predictions need to be corrected because they are not regressive and therefore are biased. Suppose that I predict for each golfer in a tournament that his score on day 2 will be the same as his score on day 1. This prediction does not allow for regression to the mean: the golfers who  fared well on day 1 will on average do less well on day 2, and those who did  poorly will mostly improve. When they are eventually compared to actual outcomes, nonregressive predictions will be found to be biased. They are on average overly optimistic for those who did best on the first day and overly pessimistic for those who had a bad start. The predictions are as extreme as the evidence. Similarly, if you use childhood achievements to predict grades in college without  regressing your predictions toward the mean, you will more often than not be disappointed by the academic outcomes of early readers and happily surprised by the grades of those who learned to read relatively late. The corrected intuitive predictions eliminate these biases, so that predictions (both high and low) are about equally likely to overestimate and to underestimate the true value. You still  make errors when your predictions are unbiased, but the errors are smaller and do not favor either high or low outcomes. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 直观的预测需要被纠正，因为它们不是回归性的，因此是有偏见的。假设我对一场比赛中的每个高尔夫球员进行预测，他在第2天的得分将与他在第1天的得分相同。这种预测不允许回归平均值：在第1天表现良好的高尔夫球员 ，在第2天平均表现较差，而那些表现不佳的  ，大多会有所提高。当他们最终与实际结果进行比较时，会发现非回归预测是有偏差的。 他们平均对那些在第一天表现最好的人过于乐观，对那些开局不利的人过于悲观。预测和证据一样极端。  同样，如果你用童年的成就来预测大学的成绩，而不把你的预测向平均值回归，你往往会对早期阅读者的学术成果感到失望，而对那些相对较晚学会阅读的人的成绩感到高兴。修正后的直观预测消除了这些偏见，因此，预测（高和低）高估和低估真实价值的可能性大致相同。当你的预测没有偏见时，你仍然  ，但误差较小，而且不偏向于高或低的结果。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Correcting your intuitive predictions is a task for System 2. Significant effort is required to find the relevant reference category, estimate the baseline prediction, and evaluate the quality of the evidence. The effort is justified only when the stakes are high and when  you are particularly keen not to make mistakes. Furthermore, you should know that correcting your intuitions may complicate your life. A characteristic of unbiased predictions is that they permit the prediction of rare or extreme events only when the information is very good. If you expect your predictions to be of modest validity, you will never guess an outcome that is either rare or far from  the mean. If your predictions are unbiased, you will never have the satisfying experience of correctly calling an extreme case. You will never be able to say, “I thought so!” when your best student in law school becomes a Supreme Court justice, or when a start-up that you thought very promising eventually becomes a major commercial success. Given the limitations of the evidence, you will never predict  that an outstanding high school student will be a straight-A student at Princeton. For the same reason, a venture capitalist will never be told that the probability of success for a start-up in its early stages is “very high.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The objections to the principle of moderating intuitive predictions must be taken seriously, because absence of bias is not always what matters most. A preference for unbiased  predictions is justified if all errors of prediction are treated alike, regardless of their direction. But there are situations in which one type of error is much worse than another. When a venture capitalist looks for “the next big thing,” the risk of missing the next Google or Facebook is far more important than the risk of making a modest investment  in a start-up that ultimately fails. The  goal of venture capitalists is to call the extreme cases correctly, even at the cost of overestimating the prospects of many other ventures. For a conservative banker making large loans, the risk of a single borrower going bankrupt may outweigh the risk of turning down several would-be clients who would fulfill their obligations. In such cases, the use of extreme language (“very good prospect,” “serious  risk of default”) may have some justification for the comfort it provides, even if the information on which these judgments are based is of only modest validity. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 必须认真对待对调节直觉预测的原则的反对意见，因为没有偏见并不总是最重要的。如果对所有的预测错误都一视同仁，无论其方向如何，对无偏见的  预测的偏爱是合理的。但在有些情况下，一种类型的错误要比另一种差得多。当风险资本家寻找 "下一个大事件 "时，错过下一个谷歌或Facebook的风险远比对一个最终失败的初创公司进行适度投资 的风险重要。  ，风险资本家的目标是正确判断极端情况，甚至以高估许多其他企业的前景为代价。对于一个保守的银行家来说，提供大额贷款，一个借款人破产的风险可能超过拒绝几个会履行其义务的潜在客户的风险。在这种情况下，使用极端的语言（"前景非常好"，"严重的  违约风险"）可能有一定的理由，因为它提供了安慰，即使这些判断所依据的信息只有一定的有效性。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> For a rational person, predictions that are unbiased and moderate should not present a problem. After all, the rational venture capitalist knows that even the most promising start-ups have only a moderate chance of success. She views  her job as picking the most promising bets from the bets that are available and does not feel the need to delude herself about the prospects of a start-up in which she plans to invest. Similarly, rational individuals predicting the revenue of a firm will not be bound to a single number—they should consider the range of uncertainty around the most likely outcome. A rational person will invest a large  sum in an enterprise that is most likely to fail if the rewards of success are large enough, without deluding herself about the chances of success. However, we are not all rational, and some of us may need the security of distorted estimates to avoid paralysis.

Galton had a hard time before he understood it. Many statistics teachers  dread the class in which the topic comes up, and their students often end up with only a vague understanding of this crucial concept. This is a case where System 2 requires special training. Matching predictions to the evidence is not only  something we do intuitively; it also seems a reasonable thing to do. We will not learn to understand regression from experience.

In  The Black Swan , Taleb introduced the notion of a  narrative fallacy  to describe how flawed stories of the  past shape our views of the world and our expectations for the future. Narrative fallacies arise inevitably from our continuous attempt to make sense of the world. The explanatory stories that people find compelling are simple; are concrete rather than abstract; assign a larger role to talent, stupidity, and intentions than to luck; and focus on a few striking events that happened rather than on the  countless events that failed to happen. Any recent salient event is a candidate to become the kernel of a causal narrative. Taleb suggests that we humans constantly fool ourselves by constructing flimsy accounts of the past and believing they are true. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Good stories provide a simple and coherent account of people’s actions and intentions. You are always ready to interpret behavior as a manifestation  of general propensities and personality traits—causes that you can readily match to effects. The halo effect discussed earlier contributes to coherence, because it inclines us to match our view of all the qualities of a person to our judgment of  one attribute that is particularly significant . If we think a baseball pitcher is handsome and athletic, for example, we are likely to rate him better  at  throwing the ball , too. Halos can also be negative: if we think a player is ugly, we will probably underrate his athletic ability. The halo effect helps keep explanatory narratives simple and coherent by exaggerating the consistency of evaluations: good people do only good things and bad people  are all bad. The statement “Hitler loved dogs and little children” is shocking no matter how many  times you hear it, because any trace of kindness in someone so evil violates the expectations set up by the halo effect. Inconsistencies reduce the ease of our thoughts and the clarity of our feelings. </p></div>

Two creative graduate students in the computer science  department at Stanford University come up with a superior way of searching information on the Internet. They seek and obtain funding to start a company and make a series of decisions that work out well. Within a few years, the company they started is one of the most valuable stocks in America, and the two former graduate students are among the richest people on the planet. On one memorable occasion,  they were lucky, which makes the story even more compelling: a year after founding Google, they were willing to  sell their company  for less than $1 million, but the buyer said the price was too high. Mentioning the single lucky incident actually makes it easier to underestimate the multitude of ways in which luck affected the outcome. </p></div>

The word is, of course,  knew . Some people thought well in advance that there would be a crisis, but they did not know it. They now say they knew it because the crisis did in fact happen. This is a misuse of an important concept. In everyday language, we apply the word  know  only when what was known is true and can be shown to be true. We can know something only if it is both true and knowable.  But the people who thought there would be a crisis (and there are fewer of them than now remember thinking it) could not conclusively show it at the time. Many intelligent and well-informed people were keenly interested in the future of the economy and did not believe a catastrophe was imminent; I infer from this fact that the crisis was not knowable. What is perverse about the use of  know  in  this context is not that some individuals get credit for prescience that they do not deserve.

<p class ="en"> Hindsight is especially unkind to decision makers who  act as agents for others—physicians, financial advisers, third-base coaches, CEOs, social workers, diplomats, politicians. We are prone to blame decision makers for good decisions that worked out badly and to give them too little credit for successful moves that appear obvious only after the fact. There is a clear  outcome bias . When the outcomes are bad, the clients often blame their agents for  not seeing the handwriting on the wall—forgetting that it was written in invisible ink that became legible only afterward. Actions that seemed prudent in foresight can look irresponsibly negligent in hindsight. Based on an actual legal case, students in California were asked whether the city of Duluth, Minnesota, should have shouldered the considerable cost of hiring a full-time bridge monitor to  protect against the risk that debris might get caught and block the free flow of water. One group was shown only the evidence available at the time of the city’s decision; 24% of these people felt that Duluth should take on the expense of hiring a flood monitor.  The second group was informed that debris had blocked the river, causing major flood damage; 56% of these people said the city  should have hired the monitor , although they had been explicitly instructed not to let hindsight distort their judgment. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The worse the consequence, the greater the hindsight bias. In the case of a catastrophe, such as 9/11, we are especially ready to believe that the officials who failed to anticipate it were negligent or blind. On July 10, 2001, the Central Intelligence Agency obtained information that al-Qaeda might be  planning a major attack against the United States. George Tenet, director of the CIA, brought the information not to President George W. Bush but to National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. When the facts later emerged, Ben Bradlee, the legendary executive editor of  The Washington Post , declared, “It seems to me elementary that if you’ve got the story that’s going to dominate history you might  as well go right to the president.” But on July 10, no one knew—or could have known—that this  tidbit of intelligence  would turn out to dominate history. </p></div>

As  malpractice litigation became more common, physicians changed their procedures in multiple ways: ordered more tests, referred more cases to specialists, applied conventional treatments even when they were unlikely to help. These actions protected the physicians more than they benefited the patients, creating the potential for conflicts of interest. Increased accountability is a mixed blessing. </p></div>

Some of the men had looked like strong leaders, others had seemed like wimps or arrogant fools, others mediocre but not hopeless. Quite a few looked so weak that we ruled them out as candidates for officer rank. When our multiple observations of each candidate converged on a coherent  story, we were completely confident in our evaluations and felt that what we had seen pointed directly to the future. The soldier who took over when the group was in trouble and led the team over the wall was a leader at that moment. The obvious best guess about how he would do in training, or in combat, was that he would be as effective then as he had been at the wall. Any other prediction seemed  inconsistent with the evidence before our eyes. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Because  our impressions of how well each soldier had performed were generally coherent and clear, our formal predictions were just as definite. A single score usually came to mind and we rarely experienced doubts or formed conflicting impressions. We were quite willing to declare, “This one will never make it,” “That fellow is mediocre, but he should  do okay,” or “He will be a star.” We felt no need to question our forecasts, moderate them, or equivocate. If challenged, however, we were prepared to admit, “But of course anything could happen.” We were willing to make that admission because, despite our definite impressions about individual candidates, we knew with certainty that our forecasts were largely useless. </p></div>

Our expectations for the soldiers’ future performance  were a clear instance of substitution, and of the representativeness heuristic in particular. Having observed one  hour of a soldier’s behavior in an artificial situation, we felt we knew how well he would face the challenges of officer training and of leadership in combat. Our predictions were completely nonregressive—we had no reservations about predicting failure or outstanding success from weak evidence. This was a clear instance of WYSIATI.

I knew so little about finance that I did not even know what to ask him, but I remember one exchange. “When you sell a stock,” I asked, “who buys it?” He answered  with a wave in the vague direction of the window, indicating that he expected the buyer to be someone else very much like him.

Billions of shares are traded every day, with many people buying each stock and others selling it to them. It is not unusual for more than 100 million  shares of a single stock to change hands in one day. Most of the buyers and sellers know that they have the same information; they exchange the stocks primarily because they have different opinions. The buyers think the price is too low and  likely to rise, while the sellers think the price is high and likely to drop. The puzzle is why buyers and sellers alike think that the current price is wrong. What makes them believe they know more about what the price should be than the market does? For most of them, that belief is an illusion. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In its broad outlines, the standard theory of how the stock market works is accepted by all the participants  in the industry. Everybody in the investment business has read Burton Malkiel’s wonderful book  A Random Walk Down Wall Street . Malkiel’s central idea is that a stock’s price incorporates all the available knowledge about the value of the company and the best predictions about the future of the stock. If some people believe that the price of a stock will be higher tomorrow, they will buy more of  it today. This, in turn, will cause its price to rise. If all assets in a market are correctly priced, no one can expect either to gain or to lose by trading. Perfect prices leave no scope for cleverness, but they also protect fools from their own folly. We now know, however, that the theory is not quite right. Many individual investors lose consistently by trading, an achievement that a dart-throwing  chimp could not match. The first demonstration of  this startling conclusion  was collected by Terry Odean, a finance professor at UC Berkeley who was once my student. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在其大致轮廓中，关于股票市场如何运作的标准理论被该行业的所有参与者所接受  。 投资行业的每个人都读过伯顿-马尔基尔的精彩著作 《华尔街的随机漫步》 。马尔基尔的中心思想是，一只股票的价格包含了所有关于公司价值的现有知识和对股票未来的最佳预测。如果有些人相信某只股票的价格明天会更高，他们今天就会买更多的  。这反过来又会导致其价格上涨。如果一个市场中的所有资产都被正确定价，那么没有人可以期望通过交易获得收益或损失。完美的价格没有给聪明人留下任何余地，但它们也保护傻瓜不受自己的愚蠢行为影响。然而，我们现在知道，这个理论并不完全正确。许多个人投资者通过交易持续亏损，这种成就是投掷飞镖的  黑猩猩无法比拟的。 这个惊人结论 的第一个证明是由加州大学伯克利分校的金融学教授特里-奥德恩收集的，他曾经是我的学生。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Odean began by studying the trading records of 10,000 brokerage accounts of individual investors spanning a seven-year period. He was able to analyze every transaction the investors executed through that firm, nearly 163,000 trades.  This rich set of data allowed Odean to identify all instances in which an investor sold some of his holdings in one stock and soon afterward bought another stock. By these actions the investor revealed that he (most of the investors were men) had a definite idea about the future of the two stocks: he expected the stock that he chose to buy to do better than the stock he chose to sell. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> Odean首先研究了1万个个人投资者的经纪账户的交易记录，时间跨度为7年。 他能够分析投资者通过该公司执行的每一笔交易，近16.3万笔交易。  这套丰富的数据使奥德恩能够识别出投资者卖出他所持有的某只股票的一部分并在不久后买入另一只股票的所有情况。通过这些行动，投资者透露出他（大多数投资者是男性）对这两只股票的未来有明确的想法：他预计他选择买入的股票会比他选择卖出的股票表现更好。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> To determine  whether those ideas were well founded, Odean compared the returns of the stock the investor had sold and the stock he had bought in its place, over the course of one year after the transaction. The results were unequivocally bad. On average, the shares that individual traders sold did better than those they bought, by a very substantial margin: 3.2 percentage points per year, above and beyond  the significant costs of executing the two trades. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 为了确定  ，这些想法是否有根有据，Odean比较了投资者卖出的股票和他买入的股票在交易后一年内的收益。 结果是明确的坏事。平均而言，个人交易者卖出的股票比他们买入的股票表现更好，幅度非常大：每年3.2个百分点，高于并超过  执行这两种交易的巨大成本。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> It  is important to remember that this is a statement about averages: some individuals did much better, others did much worse. However, it is clear that for the large majority of individual investors, taking a shower and doing nothing would have been a better policy than implementing the ideas that came to their minds. Later research by Odean  and his colleague Brad Barber supported this conclusion. In a paper titled “Trading Is Hazardous to Your Wealth,” they showed that, on average, the most active traders had the poorest results, while the investors who traded the least earned the highest returns. In another paper, titled “Boys Will Be Boys,” they showed that  men acted on their useless ideas  significantly more often than women, and  that as a result women achieved better investment results than men. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> ，重要的是要记住，这是一个关于平均数的声明：有些人做得更好，有些人做得更差。然而，很明显，对于绝大多数个人投资者来说，洗个澡，什么都不做，会比实施他们脑海中的想法要好。后来Odean  和他的同事Brad Barber的研究支持了这一结论。在一篇题为 "交易对你的财富有危害 "的论文中，他们表明，平均而言，最活跃的交易者的结果最差，而交易最少的投资者获得的回报最高。在另一篇题为 "男孩就是男孩 "的论文中，他们表明， 男性对他们的无用想法采取行动 的频率明显高于女性，并且  ，因此女性取得了比男性更好的投资结果。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Of course, there is always someone on the other side of each transaction; in general, these are financial institutions and professional investors, who are ready to take advantage of the mistakes that individual traders make in choosing a stock to sell and another stock to buy. Further research by Barber and Odean has shed light  on these mistakes. Individual investors like to lock in their gains by  selling “winners,”  stocks that have appreciated since they were purchased, and they hang on to their losers. Unfortunately for them, recent winners tend to do better than recent losers in the short run, so individuals sell the wrong stocks. They also buy the wrong stocks. Individual investors predictably flock to companies  that draw their attention because they are in the news. Professional investors are more selective in  responding to news . These findings provide some justification for the label of “smart money” that finance professionals apply to themselves. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 当然，每笔交易的另一方总是有人；一般来说，这些人是金融机构和专业投资者，他们准备利用个人交易者在选择卖出一只股票和购买另一只股票时所犯的错误。Barber和Odean的进一步研究揭示了  ，这些错误。个人投资者喜欢通过 卖出 "赢家"，即 购买后升值的股票来锁定收益，而对输家则坚持持有。对他们来说，不幸的是，从短期来看，最近的赢家往往比最近的输家做得更好，所以个人卖错了股票。他们也买错了股票。可以预见的是，个人投资者会涌向那些因为出现在新闻中而吸引他们注意力的公司  。专业投资者 对新闻的反应 更具选择性。这些发现为金融专业人员给自己贴上 "聪明钱 "的标签提供了一定的理由。 </p></div>

I asked for some data to  prepare my presentation and was granted a small treasure: a spreadsheet summarizing the investment outcomes of some twenty-five anonymous wealth advisers, for each of eight consecutive years. Each adviser’s score for each year was his (most of them were men) main determinant of his year-end bonus. It was a simple matter to rank the advisers by their performance in each year and to determine whether  there were  persistent differences in skill  among them and whether the same advisers consistently achieved better returns for their clients year after year. </p></div>

The illusion of skill is not only an individual aberration; it is deeply ingrained in the culture of the industry. Facts that challenge such basic assumptions—and thereby threaten people’s livelihood and self-esteem—are simply not absorbed. The mind does not digest them.

When asked about the length of the lines, you will report your informed belief, not the illusion that you continue to see. In contrast, when my colleagues and I in the army learned that our leadership assessment tests had low validity, we accepted that fact intellectually, but it had no impact on either our feelings or our subsequent actions.

<p class ="en"> The most potent psychological cause of the illusion is certainly that the people who pick stocks are exercising high-level skills. They consult economic data  and forecasts, they examine income statements and balance sheets, they evaluate the quality of top management, and they assess the competition. All this is serious work that requires extensive training, and the people who do it have the immediate (and valid) experience of using these skills. Unfortunately, skill in evaluating the business prospects of a firm is not sufficient for successful stock  trading, where the key question is whether the information about the firm is already incorporated in the price of its stock. Traders apparently lack the skill to answer this crucial question, but they appear to be ignorant of their ignorance. As I had discovered from watching cadets on the obstacle field, subjective confidence of traders is a feeling, not a judgment. Our understanding of cognitive  ease and associative coherence locates subjective confidence firmly in System 1. </p></div>

We think that we should be able to explain the past by focusing on either large social movements and cultural and technological developments or the intentions and abilities of a few great men. The idea that large historical events  are determined by luck is profoundly shocking, although it is demonstrably true. It is hard to think of the history of the twentieth century, including its large social movements, without bringing in the role of Hitler, Stalin, and Mao Zedong. But there was a moment in time, just before an egg was fertilized, when there was a fifty-fifty chance that the embryo that became Hitler could have been a  female. Compounding the three events, there was a probability of one-eighth of a twentieth century without any of the three great villains and it is impossible to argue that history would have been roughly the same in their absence. The fertilization of these three eggs had momentous consequences, and it makes a joke of the idea that long-term developments are predictable. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Yet the illusion of  valid prediction remains intact, a fact that is exploited by people whose business is prediction—not only financial experts but pundits in business and politics, too. Television and radio stations and newspapers have their panels of experts whose job it is to comment on the recent past and foretell the future. Viewers and readers have the impression that they are receiving information that is somehow  privileged, or at least extremely insightful. And there is no doubt that the pundits and their promoters genuinely believe they are offering such information. Philip Tetlock, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania, explored these so-called expert predictions in a landmark twenty-year study, which he published in his 2005 book  Expert Political Judgment: How Good Is It? How Can We Know?  Tetlock has set the terms for any future discussion of this topic. </p></div>

Would Gorbachev be ousted in a coup? Would the United States go to war in the Persian Gulf? Which country would become the next big emerging market? In all, Tetlock gathered more than 80,000 predictions. He also asked the experts how they reached their conclusions, how they reacted when proved wrong, and how they evaluated evidence that did not support their positions. Respondents were asked to rate  the probabilities of three alternative outcomes in every case: the persistence of the status quo, more of something such as political freedom or economic growth, or less of that thing. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Those who know more forecast very slightly better than those who know less. But those with the most knowledge are often less reliable.  The reason is that the person who acquires more knowledge develops an enhanced illusion of her skill and becomes unrealistically overconfident. “We reach the point of diminishing marginal predictive returns for knowledge disconcertingly quickly,” Tetlock writes.  “In this age of academic hyperspecialization , there is no reason for supposing that contributors to top journals—distinguished political  scientists, area study specialists, economists, and so on—are any better than journalists or attentive readers of  The New York Times  in ‘reading’ emerging situations.” The more famous the forecaster, Tetlock discovered, the more flamboyant the forecasts. “Experts in demand,” he writes, “were more overconfident than their colleagues who eked out existences far from the limelight.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Tetlock also  found that experts resisted admitting that they had been wrong, and when they were compelled to admit error, they had a large collection of excuses: they had been wrong only in their timing, an unforeseeable event had intervened, or they had been wrong but for the right reasons. Experts are just human in the end. They are dazzled by their own brilliance and hate to be wrong. Experts are led astray  not by what they believe, but by  how they think, says Tetlock. He uses the terminology from Isaiah Berlin’s essay on Tolstoy, “The Hedgehog and the Fox.” Hedgehogs “know one big thing” and have a theory about the world; they account for particular events within a coherent framework, bristle with impatience toward those who don’t see things their way, and are confident in their forecasts. They  are also especially reluctant to admit error. For hedgehogs, a failed prediction is almost always “off only on timing” or “very nearly right.” They are opinionated and clear, which is exactly what television producers love to see on programs. Two hedgehogs on different sides of an issue, each attacking the idiotic ideas of the adversary, make for a good show. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Foxes, by contrast, are complex thinkers.  They don’t believe that one big thing drives the march of history (for example, they are unlikely to accept the view that Ronald Reagan single-handedly ended the cold war by standing tall against the Soviet Union). Instead the foxes recognize that reality emerges from the interactions of many different agents and forces, including blind luck, often producing large and unpredictable outcomes.  It was the foxes who scored best in Tetlock’s study, although their performance was still very poor. But they are less likely than hedgehogs to be invited to participate in television debates. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 相比之下，狐狸是复杂的思考者。  他们不相信有一件大事推动了历史的发展（例如，他们不太可能接受罗纳德-里根通过站在高处对抗苏联而单枪匹马地结束了冷战的观点）。相反，狐狸们认识到，现实是由许多不同的代理人和力量的相互作用产生的，包括盲目的运气，往往会产生巨大和不可预测的结果。  在特洛克的研究中，狐狸们得分最高，尽管他们的表现仍然非常糟糕。但他们比刺猬更不可能被邀请参加电视辩论。 </p></div>

A statistically sophisticated researcher and a fierce critic of empty claims in clinical psychology, Meehl was also a practicing psychoanalyst. He wrote thoughtful essays on the philosophical foundations of psychological research that I almost memorized while I was  a graduate student.

<p class ="en"> In the slim volume that he later called “my disturbing little book,” Meehl reviewed the results of 20 studies that had analyzed whether  clinical predictions  based on the subjective impressions of trained professionals  were more accurate than  statistical  predictions made by combining a few scores or ratings according to a rule. In a typical study, trained counselors predicted the grades of freshmen at the end of the school year. The counselors interviewed each student for forty-five minutes. They also had access to high school grades, several aptitude tests, and a four-page personal statement. The statistical  algorithm used only a fraction of this information: high school grades and one aptitude test. Nevertheless, the formula was more accurate than 11 of the 14 counselors. Meehl reported generally similar  results across a variety of other forecast outcomes, including violations of parole, success in pilot training, and criminal recidivism. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Not surprisingly, Meehl’s book provoked shock and disbelief  among clinical psychologists, and the controversy it started has engendered a stream of research that is still flowing today, more than fifty years after its publication. The number of studies reporting comparisons of clinical and statistical predictions has increased to roughly two hundred, but the score in the contest between algorithms and humans has not changed. About 60% of the studies have  shown significantly better accuracy for the algorithms. The other comparisons scored a draw in accuracy, but a tie is tantamount to a win for the statistical rules, which are normally much less expensive to use than expert judgment.

The industry is also helped by wet springs, which increase quantity without much effect on quality. Ashenfelter converted that conventional knowledge into a statistical formula that predicts the price of a wine—for a particular property and at a particular age—by three features of the weather:  the average temperature over the summer growing season, the amount of rain at harvest-time, and the total rainfall during the previous winter. His formula provides accurate price forecasts years and even decades into the future. Indeed, his formula forecasts future prices much more accurately than the current prices of young wines do. This new example of a “Meehl pattern” challenges the abilities  of the experts whose opinions help shape the early price. It also challenges economic theory, according to which prices should reflect all the available information, including the weather. Ashenfelter’s formula is extremely accurate—the correlation between his predictions and actual prices is above .90. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Why are experts inferior to algorithms? One reason, which Meehl suspected, is that experts  try to be clever, think outside the box, and consider complex combinations of features in making their predictions. Complexity may work in the odd case, but more often than not it reduces validity. Simple combinations of features are better. Several studies have shown that human decision makers are inferior to a prediction formula even when they are given the score suggested by the formula! They  feel that they can overrule the formula because they have additional information about the case, but they are wrong more often than not. According to Meehl, there are few circumstances under which it is a good idea to substitute judgment for a formula. In a famous thought experiment, he described a formula that predicts whether a particular person will go to the movies tonight and noted that it is  proper to disregard the formula if information is received that the individual broke a leg today. The name “broken-leg rule” has stuck. The point, of course, is that broken legs are very rare—as well as decisive. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 为什么专家不如算法？Meehl怀疑的一个原因是，专家们  ，试图变得聪明，跳出框框，并在作出预测时考虑复杂的特征组合。 复杂可能在奇特的情况下起作用，但更多的时候会降低有效性。 简单的特征组合会更好。一些研究表明，人类决策者不如预测公式，即使他们得到了公式所建议的分数也是如此。他们  ，觉得他们可以推翻公式，因为他们有关于案件的额外信息，但他们往往是错的。根据Meehl的说法，在少数情况下，用判断来代替公式是一个好主意。在一个著名的思想实验中，他描述了一个预测某个人今晚是否会去看电影的公式，并指出，如果收到该人今天摔断腿的信息，不考虑这个公式是  。"摔断腿规则 "这个名字一直流传至今。当然，问题的关键在于，断腿是非常罕见的，也是决定性的。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Another reason for the inferiority of expert judgment is that humans are incorrigibly inconsistent in making summary judgments of complex information. When asked to evaluate the same  information twice, they frequently  give different answers. The extent of the inconsistency is often a matter of real concern.  Experienced radiologists  who evaluate chest X-rays as “normal” or “abnormal” contradict themselves 20% of the time when they see the same picture on separate occasions. A study of 101 independent auditors who were asked to evaluate the reliability of  internal corporate audits  revealed a similar degree of inconsistency. A review of  41 separate studies  of the reliability of judgments made by auditors, pathologists, psychologists, organizational managers, and other professionals suggests that this level of inconsistency is typical, even when a case is reevaluated within a few minutes. Unreliable judgments cannot be valid predictors of anything. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 专家判断力低下的另一个原因是，人类在对复杂信息进行总结性判断时不可救药地不一致。当被要求对相同的  信息进行两次评估时，他们经常 ，给出不同的答案。不一致的程度往往是一个真正令人担忧的问题。 有经验的放射科医生 将胸部X射线评价为 "正常 "或 "不正常"，当他们在不同场合看到同一张照片时，有20%的时间是自相矛盾的。一项对101名独立审计师的研究，他们被要求评价 企业内部审计 的可靠性，  ，显示出类似程度的不一致。对审计师、病理学家、心理学家、组织管理者和其他专业人士所做判断的可靠性的 41项独立研究 的审查表明，这种程度的不一致是典型的，即使是在几分钟内对一个案例进行重新评估。 不可靠的判断不可能成为任何有效的预测因素。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The widespread inconsistency  is probably due to the extreme context dependency of System 1. We know from studies of priming that unnoticed stimuli in our environment have a substantial influence on our thoughts and actions. These influences fluctuate from moment to moment. The brief pleasure of a cool breeze on a hot day may make you slightly more positive and optimistic about whatever you are evaluating at the time. The  prospects of a convict being granted parole may change significantly during the time that elapses between  successive food breaks  in the parole judges’ schedule. Because you have little direct knowledge of what goes on in your mind, you will never know that you might have made a different judgment or reached a different decision under very slightly different circumstances. Formulas do not suffer  from such problems. Given the same input, they always return the same answer. When predictability is poor—which it is in most of the studies reviewed by Meehl and his followers—inconsistency is destructive of any predictive validity. </p></div>
<div class="top right">

<p class ="en"> The research suggests a surprising conclusion: to maximize predictive accuracy, final decisions should be left to formulas, especially in low-validity environments.  In admission decisions for medical schools, for example, the final determination is often made by the faculty members who interview the candidate. The evidence is fragmentary, but there are solid grounds for a conjecture: conducting an interview is likely to diminish the accuracy of a selection procedure, if the interviewers also make the final admission decisions. Because interviewers are overconfident  in their intuitions, they will assign too much weight to their personal impressions and too little weight to other sources of information,  lowering validity . Similarly, the experts who evaluate the quality of immature wine to predict its future have a source of information that almost certainly makes things worse rather than better: they can taste the wine. In addition, of course, even if they  have a  good understanding of the effects of the weather on wine quality, they will not be able to maintain the consistency of a formula. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 该研究提出了一个令人惊讶的结论：为了最大限度地提高预测的准确性，最后的决定应该留给公式，特别是在低效力的环境中。  例如，在医学院的录取决定中，最后的决定往往是由面试候选人的教员作出。证据是零散的，但有确凿的理由进行猜想：如果面试官也做出最后的录取决定，那么进行面试很可能会降低选拔程序的准确性。因为面试官对自己的直觉过于自信  ，他们会对个人印象赋予过多的权重，而对其他信息来源的权重过低， 降低了有效性 。 同样，评估未成熟葡萄酒质量以预测其未来的专家有一个信息来源，几乎肯定会使事情变得更糟而不是更好：他们可以品尝葡萄酒。 当然，此外，即使他们  ，对天气对葡萄酒质量的影响有很好的了解，他们也无法保持配方的一致性。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The most important development in the field since Meehl’s original work is Robyn  Dawes’s famous article  “The Robust Beauty of Improper Linear Models in Decision Making.” The dominant statistical practice in the social sciences is to assign weights to the different  predictors by following an algorithm, called multiple regression, that is now built into conventional software. The logic of multiple regression is unassailable: it finds the optimal formula for putting together a weighted combination of the predictors. However, Dawes observed that the complex statistical algorithm adds little or no value. One can do just as well by selecting a set of scores  that have some validity for predicting the outcome and adjusting the values to make them comparable (by using standard scores or ranks). A formula that combines these predictors with equal weights is likely to be just as accurate in predicting new cases as the multiple-regression formula that was optimal in the original sample. More recent research went further: formulas that assign equal weights  to all the predictors are often superior, because they are  not affected by accidents of sampling . </p></div>

<p class ="en"> A classic application of this approach is a simple algorithm that has saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of infants. Obstetricians had always known that an infant who is not breathing normally  within a few  minutes of birth is at high risk of brain damage or death. Until the anesthesiologist Virginia Apgar intervened in 1953, physicians and midwives used their clinical judgment to determine whether a baby was in distress. Different practitioners focused on different cues. Some watched for breathing problems while others monitored how soon the baby cried. Without a standardized procedure,  danger signs were often missed, and many newborn infants died. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> One day over breakfast, a medical resident asked how  Dr. Apgar  would make a systematic assessment of a newborn. “That’s easy,” she replied. “You would do it like this.” Apgar jotted down five variables (heart rate, respiration, reflex, muscle tone, and color) and three scores (0, 1, or 2, depending on the robustness of each sign).  Realizing that she might have made a breakthrough that any delivery room could implement, Apgar began rating infants by this rule one minute after they were born. A baby with a total score of 8 or above was likely to be pink, squirming, crying, grimacing, with a pulse of 100 or more—in good shape. A baby with a score of 4 or below was probably bluish, flaccid, passive, with a slow or weak pulse—in  need of immediate intervention. Applying Apgar’s score, the staff in delivery rooms finally had consistent standards for determining which babies were in trouble, and the formula is credited for an important contribution to reducing infant mortality. The Apgar test is still used every day in every delivery room. Atul Gawande’s recent  A Checklist Manifesto  provides many other examples of the  virtues of checklists  and simple rules. </p></div>

Instead, we should use the limited time at our disposal to obtain as much specific information as possible about the interviewee’s life in his normal environment. Another lesson I learned from Meehl was that we should abandon the procedure in which the interviewers’  global evaluations of the recruit determined the final decision. Meehl’s book suggested that such evaluations should not be trusted and that statistical summaries of separately evaluated attributes would achieve higher validity. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> I decided on a procedure in which the interviewers would evaluate several relevant personality traits and score each separately. The final score of fitness for combat  duty would be computed according to a standard formula, with no further input from the interviewers. I made up a list of six characteristics  that appeared relevant to performance in a combat unit, including “responsibility,” “sociability,” and “masculine pride.” I then composed, for each trait, a series of factual questions about the individual’s life before his enlistment, including the number  of different jobs he had held, how regular and punctual he had been in his work or studies, the frequency of his interactions with friends, and his interest and participation in sports, among others. The idea was to evaluate as objectively as possible how well the recruit had done on each dimension. </p></div>

And that was that. I informed the interviewers that they need not concern themselves with the recruit’s future adjustment to the military. Their only task was to  elicit relevant facts about his past and to use that information to score each personality dimension. “Your function is to provide reliable measurements,” I told them. “Leave the predictive validity to me,” by which I meant the formula that I was going to devise to combine their specific ratings. </p></div>

Implementing interview procedures in the spirit of Meehl and Dawes requires relatively little effort but substantial discipline. Suppose that you need to hire a sales representative for your firm. If you are serious about hiring the best possible person for the job, this  is what you should do. First, select a few traits that are prerequisites for success in this position (technical proficiency, engaging personality, reliability, and so on). Don’t overdo it—six dimensions is a good number. The traits you choose should be as independent as possible from each other, and you should feel that you can assess them reliably by asking a few factual questions. Next, make a  list of those questions for each trait and think about how you will score it, say on a 1–5 scale. You should have an idea of what you will call “very weak” or “very strong.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Professional controversies bring out the worst in academics. Scientific journals occasionally publish exchanges, often beginning with someone’s critique of another’s research, followed by  a reply and a rejoinder. I have always thought that these exchanges are a waste of time. Especially when the original critique is sharply worded, the reply and the rejoinder are often exercises in what I have called sarcasm for beginners and advanced sarcasm. The replies rarely concede anything to a biting critique, and it is almost unheard of for a rejoinder to admit that the original critique was  misguided or erroneous in any way. On a few occasions I have responded to criticisms that I thought were grossly misleading, because a failure to respond can be interpreted as conceding error, but I have never found the hostile exchanges instructive. In search of another way to deal with disagreements, I have engaged in a few “adversarial collaborations,” in which scholars who disagree on the science  agree to write a jointly authored paper on their differences, and sometimes conduct research together. In especially tense situations, the research is  moderated by an arbiter . </p></div>

Gladwell’s book opens with the memorable story of art experts faced with an object that is described as a magnificent example of a  kouros , a sculpture of a striding boy. Several of the experts had strong visceral reactions: they felt in their gut that the statue was a fake but were not able to articulate what it was about it that made them uneasy. Everyone who  read the book—millions did—remembers that story as a triumph of intuition. The experts agreed that they knew the sculpture was a fake without knowing how they knew—the very definition of intuition. The story appears to imply that a systematic search for the cue that guided the experts would have failed, but Klein and I both rejected that conclusion. From our point of view, such an inquiry was needed,  and if it had been conducted properly (which Klein knows how to do), it would probably have succeeded. </p></div>

Square jawed and tall, he was the perfect image of a strong and decisive leader. People voted for someone who looked strong and decisive without any other reason to believe that he was. An intuitive prediction of how Harding would perform as president arose from substituting one question for another.

<p class ="en"> Klein elaborated this description into a  theory of decision making that he called the recognition-primed decision (RPD) model, which applies to firefighters but also describes expertise in other domains, including chess. The  process involves both System 1 and System 2. In the first phase, a tentative plan comes to mind by an automatic function of associative memory—System 1. The next phase is a deliberate process in which the plan is  mentally simulated to check if it will work—an operation of System 2. The model of intuitive decision making as pattern recognition develops ideas presented some time ago by Herbert Simon, perhaps the only scholar who is recognized and  admired as a hero  and founding figure by all the competing clans and tribes in the study of decision making. I quoted Herbert Simon’s definition of intuition in  the introduction, but it will make more sense when I repeat it now: “The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and  nothing less than recognition .” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> How does the information that supports intuition get “stored in memory”? Certain types of intuitions are acquired very quickly. We have inherited from our ancestors a great facility to learn when to be afraid. Indeed, one experience is often sufficient to establish a long-term aversion and fear. Many of us have the visceral memory of  a single dubious dish that still leaves us vaguely reluctant to return to a restaurant. All of us tense up when we approach a spot in which an unpleasant event occurred, even when there is no reason to expect it to happen again. For me, one such place is the ramp leading to the San Francisco airport, where years ago a driver in the throes of road rage followed me from the freeway, rolled down his  window, and hurled obscenities at me.

<p class ="en"> My memory of the airport incident is conscious and it fully explains the emotion that comes with it. On many occasions, however, you may feel uneasy in a particular place or when someone uses a particular turn of phrase without having a conscious  memory of the triggering event. In hindsight,  you will label that unease an intuition if it is followed by a bad experience. This mode of emotional learning is closely related to what happened in Pavlov’s famous conditioning experiments, in which the dogs learned to recognize the sound of the bell as a signal that food was coming. What Pavlov’s dogs learned can be described as a learned hope.  Learned fears are even more easily acquired. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Emotional learning may be quick, but what we consider as “expertise” usually takes a long time to develop. The acquisition of expertise in complex tasks such as high-level chess, professional  basketball, or firefighting is intricate and slow because expertise in a domain is not a single skill but rather a large collection of miniskills. Chess is a good example. An expert player can understand a complex position at a glance, but it takes years to develop that level of ability. Studies of chess masters have shown that at least  10,000 hours  of dedicated practice (about 6 years of playing  chess 5 hours a day) are required to attain the highest levels of performance. During those hours of intense concentration, a serious chess player becomes familiar with thousands of configurations, each consisting of an arrangement of related pieces that can threaten or defend each other. </p></div>

The associative machine is set to suppress doubt and to evoke ideas and information that are compatible with the currently dominant story. A mind that follows  WY SIATI will achieve high confidence much too easily by ignoring what it does not know. It is therefore not surprising that many of us are prone to have high confidence in unfounded intuitions.

The clinicians’ predicament  was less extreme than the zero-validity environment of long-term political forecasting, but they operated in low-validity situations that did not allow high accuracy. We know this to be the case because the best statistical algorithms, although more accurate than human judges, were never very accurate. Indeed, the  studies by Meehl and his followers never produced a “smoking gun” demonstration,  a case in which clinicians completely missed a highly valid cue that the algorithm detected. An extreme failure of this kind is unlikely because human learning is normally efficient. If a strong predictive cue exists, human observers will find it, given a decent opportunity to do so. Statistical algorithms greatly outdo humans in noisy environments for two reasons: they are more likely than human  judges to detect weakly valid cues and much more likely to maintain a modest level of accuracy by using such cues consistently. </p></div>

As you were mastering the skill of taking curves, you gradually learned when to let go of the accelerator and when and how hard to use the brakes. Curves differ, and the variability you experienced while learning ensures that you are now ready to brake at the right time and strength for any curve you encounter.  The conditions for learning this skill are ideal, because you receive immediate and unambiguous feedback every time you go around a bend: the mild reward of a comfortable turn or the mild punishment of some difficulty in handling the car if you brake either too hard or not quite hard enough. The situations that face a harbor pilot maneuvering large ships are no less regular, but skill is much  more difficult to acquire by sheer experience because of the long delay between actions and their noticeable outcomes.

Surgeons can be much more proficient in some operations than in others. Furthermore, some aspects of any professional’s tasks are much easier to learn than others. Psychotherapists have  many opportunities to observe the immediate reactions of patients to what they say. The feedback enables them to develop the intuitive skill to find the words and the tone that will calm anger, forge confidence, or focus the patient’s attention. On the other hand, therapists do not have a chance to identify which general treatment approach is most suitable for different patients. The feedback  they receive from their patients’ long-term outcomes is sparse, delayed, or (usually) nonexistent, and in any case too ambiguous to support learning from experience. </p></div>

It is tempting for her to conclude that she can also anticipate how well the patient will do next year, but this conclusion is not equally justified. Short-term anticipation and long-term forecasting are different tasks, and  the therapist has had adequate opportunity to learn one but not the other. Similarly, a financial expert may have skills in many aspects of his trade but not in picking stocks, and an expert in the Middle East knows many things but not the future. The clinical psychologist, the stock picker, and the pundit do have intuitive skills in some of their tasks, but they have not learned to identify the  situations and the tasks in which intuition will betray them.

You may want to forecast the commercial future of a company, for example, and believe that this is what you are judging, while in fact your evaluation is dominated by your impressions  of the energy and competence of its current executives. Because substitution occurs automatically, you often do not know the origin of a judgment that you (your System 2) endorse and adopt.

<p class ="en"> As the title of our article suggests, Klein and I disagreed less than we had expected and accepted joint solutions of almost all the substantive issues that were  raised. However, we also found that our early differences were more than an intellectual disagreement. We had different attitudes, emotions, and tastes, and those changed remarkably little over the years. This is most obvious in the facts that we find amusing and interesting. Klein still winces when the word  bias  is mentioned, and he still enjoys stories in which algorithms or formal procedures  lead to obviously absurd decisions. I tend to view the occasional failures of algorithms as opportunities to improve them. On the other hand, I find more pleasure than Klein does in the comeuppance of arrogant experts who claim intuitive powers in zero-validity situations. In the long run, however, finding as much intellectual agreement as we did is surely more important than the persistent emotional  differences that remained. </p></div>

The team that  I assembled to design the curriculum and write a textbook for it included several experienced teachers, some of my psychology students, and Seymour Fox, then dean of the Hebrew University’s School of Education, who was an expert in curriculum development. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> After meeting every Friday afternoon for about a year, we had constructed a detailed outline of the syllabus, had written a couple of chapters,  and had run a few sample lessons in the classroom. We all felt that we had made good progress. One day, as we were discussing procedures for estimating uncertain quantities, the idea of conducting an exercise occurred to me. I asked everyone to write down an estimate of how long it would take us to submit a finished draft of the textbook to the Ministry of Education. I was following a procedure  that we already planned to incorporate into our curriculum: the proper way to elicit information from a group is not by starting with a public discussion but by confidentially collecting each person’s judgment. This procedure makes better use of the knowledge available to members of the group than the common practice of open discussion. I collected the estimates and jotted the results on the blackboard.  They were narrowly centered around two years; the low end was one and a half, the high end two and a half years. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在大约一年的时间里，我们每周五下午开会，构建了一个详细的教学大纲，写了几个章节，  ，并在课堂上上了几节样板课。我们都觉得我们已经取得了良好的进展。有一天，当我们讨论估计不确定数量的程序时，我想到了进行一次练习的想法。我让每个人写下我们向教育部提交教科书成品草案所需的估计时间。我是按照我们已经计划纳入课程的程序  ：从一个群体中获取信息的正确方法不是从公开讨论开始，而是秘密地收集每个人的判断。与公开讨论的常见做法相比，这种程序能更好地利用小组成员所掌握的知识。我收集了估计值，并在黑板上记下了结果。  ，它们都是以两年为中心狭长的；低端是一年半，高端是两年半。 </p></div>

<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Then I had another idea. I turned to Seymour, our curriculum expert,  and asked whether he could think of other teams similar to ours that had developed a curriculum from scratch. This was a time when several pedagogical innovations like “new math” had been introduced, and Seymour said  he could think of quite a few. I then asked whether he knew the history of these teams in some detail, and it turned out that he was familiar with several. I asked him to think of these teams when they had made as much progress as we had. How long, from that point, did it take them to finish their textbook projects? </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 然后我有了另一个想法。我转向我们的课程专家西摩， ，问他是否能想到其他与我们类似的团队，从零开始开发课程。这时已经出现了一些像 "新数学 "这样的教学创新，西摩说  ，他能想到不少。我接着问他是否对这些团队的历史有一些详细的了解，结果发现他对几个团队都很熟悉。我让他想一想，当这些团队取得和我们一样多的进步时。从那时起，他们花了多长时间来完成他们的教科书项目？ </p></div>

<p class ="en"> He fell silent. When he finally spoke, it seemed to me that he was blushing,  embarrassed by his own answer: “You know, I never realized this before, but in fact not all the teams at a stage comparable to ours ever did complete their task. A substantial fraction of the teams ended up failing to finish the job.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">

<p class ="en"> This was worrisome; we had never considered the possibility that we might fail. My anxiety rising, I asked how large he estimated that fraction was. “About 40%,”  he answered. By now, a pall of gloom was falling over the room. The next question was obvious: “Those who finished,” I asked. “How long did it take them?” “I cannot think of any group that finished in less than seven years,” he replied, “nor any that took more than ten.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> I grasped at a straw: “When you compare our skills and resources to those of the other groups, how good are we?

Until I prompted him, there was no connection in his mind between his knowledge of the history of other teams and his  forecast of our future. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Our state of mind when we heard Seymour is not well described by stating what we “knew.” Surely all of us “knew” that a minimum of seven years and a 40% chance of failure was a more plausible forecast of the fate of our project than the numbers we had written on our slips of paper a few minutes earlier. But we did not acknowledge what we knew. The new forecast still seemed  unreal, because we could not imagine how it could take so long to finish a project that looked so manageable. No crystal ball was available to tell us the strange sequence of unlikely events that were in our future. All we could see was a reasonable plan that should produce a book in about two years, conflicting with statistics indicating that other teams had failed or had taken an absurdly long  time to complete their mission. What we had heard was base-rate information, from which we should have inferred a causal  story: if so many teams failed, and if those that succeeded took so long, writing a curriculum was surely much harder than we had thought. But such an inference would have conflicted with our direct experience of the good progress we had been making. The statistics that Seymour  provided were treated as base rates normally are—noted and promptly set aside. </p></div>

The first was immediately apparent: I had stumbled onto a distinction between two profoundly different approaches to forecasting, which Amos and I later labeled the  inside view and the outside view . The second lesson was that our initial forecasts  of about two years for the completion of the project exhibited a planning fallacy. Our estimates were closer to a best-case scenario than to a realistic assessment.

The  inside view  is the one that all of us, including Seymour, spontaneously adopted to assess the future of our project. We focused on our specific circumstances and searched for evidence in our own experiences. We had a sketchy plan: we knew how many  chapters we were going to write, and we had an idea of how long it had taken us to write the two that we had already done.

<p class ="en"> Extrapolating was a mistake. We were forecasting based on the information  in front of us—WYSIATI—but the chapters we wrote first were probably easier than others, and our commitment  to the project was probably then at its peak. But the main problem was that we failed to allow for what Donald Rumsfeld famously called the “unknown unknowns.” There was no way for us to foresee, that day, the succession of events that would cause the project to drag out for so long. The divorces, the illnesses, the crises of coordination with bureaucracies that delayed the work could not be  anticipated. Such events not only cause the writing of chapters to slow down, they also produce long periods during which little or no progress is made at all. The same must have been true, of course, for the other teams that Seymour knew about. The members of those teams were also unable to imagine the events that would cause them to spend seven years to finish, or ultimately fail to finish, a project  that they evidently had thought was very feasible. Like us, they did not know the odds they were facing. There are many ways for any plan to fail, and although most of them are too improbable to be anticipated, the likelihood that  something  will go wrong in a big project is high. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 推断是一个错误。我们是根据摆在我们面前的信息 ，即YYSIATI进行预测的，但我们先写的章节可能比其他章节更容易，而且我们对项目的承诺  ，当时可能处于高峰期。但主要问题是，我们没有考虑到唐纳德-拉姆斯菲尔德著名的 "未知数"。那一天，我们没有办法预见到将导致该项目拖得如此之久的一系列事件。离婚、疾病、与官僚机构协调的危机，这些都耽误了工作，无法  。这些事件不仅导致章节的写作速度减慢，还产生了很长一段时间，期间几乎没有进展。 当然，西摩知道的其他团队也一定是如此。这些团队的成员也无法想象会有什么事件导致他们花七年时间来完成，或者最终无法完成一个他们显然认为非常可行的项目  。和我们一样，他们也不知道他们所面临的几率。 任何计划都有很多失败的方式，尽管其中大多数都是不可能预料的，但在一个大项目中出错 的 可能性是很大的。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The second question I asked Seymour directed his attention away from us and toward a class of similar cases. Seymour  estimated the base rate of success in that reference class: 40% failure and seven to ten years for completion. His informal survey was surely not up to scientific standards of evidence, but it provided a reasonable basis for a baseline prediction: the prediction you make about a case if you know nothing except the category to which it belongs. As we saw earlier, the  baseline prediction  should  be the anchor for further adjustments. If you are asked to guess the height of a woman about whom you know only that she lives in New York City, your baseline prediction is your best guess of the average height of women in the city. If you are now given case-specific information, for example that the woman’s son is the starting center of his high school basketball team, you will adjust your estimate  away from the mean in the appropriate direction. Seymour’s comparison of our team to others suggested that the forecast of our outcome was slightly worse than the baseline prediction, which was already grim. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 我问西摩的第二个问题把他的注意力从我们身上引开，引向了一类类似的案例。西摩  ，估计了这一类参考案例的基本成功率：40%失败，7到10年完成。他的非正式调查当然达不到科学的证据标准，但它为基线预测提供了一个合理的基础：如果你对一个案例一无所知，只知道它属于哪一类，你就会做出预测。  正如我们前面所看到的， 基线预测 应该是进一步调整的锚。如果让你猜测一个女人的身高，而你只知道她住在纽约市，你的基线预测就是你对该市女性平均身高的最佳猜测。如果你现在得到了特定案例的信息，例如，这个女人的儿子是他高中篮球队的首发中锋，你将在适当的方向上调整你的估计  ，远离平均值。 西摩将我们的团队与其他人进行比较，表明我们的结果预测比基线预测略差，而基线预测已经很严峻。 </p></div>

He had in his head all the knowledge required to estimate the  statistics  of an appropriate reference class, but he reached his initial estimate without ever using that knowledge.

A proud emphasis on the uniqueness of cases is also common in medicine, in spite of recent advances in evidence-based  medicine that point the other way. Medical statistics and baseline predictions come up with increasing frequency in conversations between patients and physicians. However, the remaining ambivalence about the outside view in the medical profession is expressed in concerns about the  impersonality of procedures  that are guided by statistics and checklists. </p></div>

Some of my  friends got bored with the story, but I kept drawing new lessons from it. Almost fifteen years after I first reported on the planning fallacy with Amos, I returned to the topic with Dan Lovallo. Together we sketched a theory of decision making in which the optimistic bias is a significant source of risk taking. In the standard rational model of economics, people take risks because the odds are favorable—they  accept some probability of a costly failure because the probability of success is sufficient. We proposed an alternative idea. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The project was my initiative, and it was therefore my responsibility to ensure that it made sense and that major problems were properly discussed by the team,  but I failed that test. My problem was no longer the planning fallacy. I was cured of that fallacy as soon as I heard Seymour’s statistical summary. If pressed, I would have said that our earlier estimates had been absurdly optimistic. If pressed further, I would have admitted that we had started the project on faulty premises and that we should at least consider seriously the option of declaring  defeat and going home. But nobody pressed me and there was no discussion; we tacitly agreed to go on without an explicit forecast of how long the effort would last. This was easy to do because we had not made such a forecast to begin with. If we had had a reasonable baseline prediction when we started, we would not have gone into it, but we had already invested a great deal of effort—an instance  of the  sunk-cost fallacy , which we will look at more closely in the next part of the book. It would have been embarrassing for us—especially for me—to give up at that point, and there seemed to be no immediate reason to do so. It is easier to change directions in a crisis, but this was not a crisis, only some new facts about people we did not know. The outside view was much easier to ignore than  bad news in our own effort. I can best describe our state as a form of lethargy—an unwillingness to think about what had happened. So we carried on. There was no further attempt at rational planning for the rest of the time I spent as a member of the team—a particularly troubling omission for a team dedicated to teaching rationality. I hope I am wiser today, and I have acquired a habit of looking  for the outside view. But it will never be the natural thing to do. </p></div>

An optimistic attitude is largely inherited, and it is part of a general disposition for well-being, which may also include a preference  for seeing the  bright side of everything . If you were allowed one wish for your child, seriously consider wishing him or her optimism. Optimists are normally cheerful and happy, and therefore popular; they are resilient in adapting to failures and hardships, their chances of clinical depression are reduced, their immune system is stronger, they take better care of their health, they feel healthier  than others and are in fact likely to live longer. A study of  people who exaggerate their expected life span beyond actuarial predictions showed that they work longer hours, are more optimistic about their future income, are more likely to remarry after divorce (the classic  “triumph of hope over experience” ), and are more prone to bet on individual stocks. Of course, the blessings of optimism  are offered only to individuals who are only mildly biased and who are able to “accentuate the positive” without losing track of reality. </p></div>

They are probably optimistic by temperament; a survey of founders of small businesses concluded that entrepreneurs are  more sanguine than midlevel managers  about life in general. Their experiences of success have confirmed their faith in their judgment and in their ability to control events.  Their self-confidence is reinforced by the  admiration of others .

Because they misread the risks, optimistic entrepreneurs often believe they are prudent, even when they are not.

An impressive series of studies by Thomas Åstebro sheds light on what happens when optimists receive  bad news. He drew his data from a Canadian organization—the Inventor’s Assistance Program—which collects a small fee to provide inventors with an objective assessment of the commercial prospects of their idea. The evaluations rely on careful ratings of each invention on 37 criteria, including need for the product, cost of production, and estimated trend of demand. The analysts summarize their ratings  by a letter grade, where D and E predict failure—a prediction made for over 70% of the inventions they review. The forecasts of failure are remarkably accurate: only 5 of 411 projects that were  given the lowest grade  reached commercialization, and none was successful. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Discouraging news led about half of the inventors to quit after receiving a grade that unequivocally predicted failure. However,  47% of them continued development efforts even after being told that their project was hopeless, and on average these persistent (or obstinate) individuals doubled their initial losses before giving up. Significantly, persistence after discouraging advice was relatively common among inventors who had a high score on a personality measure of optimism—on which inventors generally scored higher than  the general population. Overall, the return on private invention was small, “lower than the return on private equity and on high-risk securities.” More generally, the financial benefits of self-employment are mediocre: given the same qualifications, people achieve higher average returns by selling their skills to employers than by setting out on their own.

<p class ="en"> Psychologists  have confirmed that most people genuinely believe that they are superior to most others on most desirable traits—they are willing to  bet small amounts of money  on these beliefs in the laboratory. In the market, of course, beliefs in one’s superiority have significant consequences. Leaders of large businesses sometimes make huge bets in expensive  mergers and acquisitions, acting on the mistaken belief that they can manage the assets of another company better than its current owners do. The stock market commonly responds by downgrading the value of the acquiring firm, because experience has shown that efforts to integrate large firms fail more often than they succeed. The misguided acquisitions have been explained by a  “hubris hypothesis” : the executives of the acquiring firm are simply less competent than they think they are. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The economists Ulrike Malmendier and Geoffrey Tate identified optimistic CEOs by the amount of company stock that they owned personally and observed that highly optimistic leaders took excessive risks. They assumed debt rather than issue equity and were more likely than others to “overpay for target companies  and undertake  value-destroying mergers .” Remarkably, the stock of the acquiring company suffered substantially more in mergers if the CEO was overly optimistic by the authors’ measure. The stock market is apparently able to identify overconfident CEOs. This observation exonerates the CEOs from one accusation even as it convicts them of another: the leaders of enterprises who make unsound bets  do not do so because they are betting with other people’s money. On the contrary, they take greater risks when they personally have more at stake. The damage caused by overconfident CEOs is compounded when the business press anoints them as celebrities; the evidence indicates that prestigious press awards to the CEO are costly to stockholders. The authors write, “We find that firms with award-winning  CEOs subsequently underperform, in terms both of stock and of operating performance. At the same time, CEO compensation increases, CEOs spend more time on activities outside the company such as writing books and sitting on outside boards, and they are more likely to  engage in earnings management .” </p></div>

Even when they are not sure they will succeed, these bold people think their fate is almost entirely in their own hands. They are surely wrong: the outcome of a start-up depends as much on the achievements of its competitors and on changes in the market as on its own efforts. However, WY SIATI plays its part, and entrepreneurs naturally focus on what they know best—their plans and actions and  the most immediate threats and opportunities, such as the availability of funding. They know less about their competitors and therefore find it natural to imagine a future in which the competition plays little part. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> For a number of years, professors at Duke University conducted a survey in which the chief financial officers of large corporations estimated the returns of the Standard & Poor’s index over the following year. The Duke scholars collected 11,600 such forecasts and examined their accuracy. The conclusion was straightforward: financial officers of large corporations had  no clue about the short-term future of the stock market; the correlation between their estimates and the true value was slightly less than zero! When they said the market would go down, it was slightly more likely than not that it would go up. These findings are not surprising. The truly bad news is that the CFOs did not appear to know that their forecasts were worthless. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In addition to their  best guess about S&P returns, the participants provided two other estimates: a value that they were 90% sure would be too high, and one that they were 90% sure would be too low. The range between the two values is called an “80% confidence interval” and outcomes that fall outside the interval are labeled “surprises.” An individual who sets confidence intervals on multiple occasions expects about  20% of the outcomes to  be surprises. As frequently happens in such exercises, there were far too many surprises; their incidence was 67%, more than 3 times higher than expected. This shows that CFOs were grossly overconfident about their ability to forecast the market.  Overconfidence  is another manifestation of WYSIATI: when we estimate a quantity, we rely on information that comes to mind and  construct a coherent story in which the estimate makes sense. Allowing for the information that does not come to mind—perhaps because one never knew it—is impossible. </p></div>

The wide confidence interval is a confession of ignorance, which is not socially acceptable for someone who is paid to be knowledgeable in financial matters. Even if they knew how little they know, the executives would be penalized for admitting it.

The study of CFOs showed that those who were most confident and optimistic about the S&P index were also overconfident and optimistic about the prospects  of their own firm, which went on to take more risk than others. As Nassim Taleb has argued, inadequate appreciation of the uncertainty of the environment inevitably leads economic agents to take risks they should avoid. However, optimism is highly valued, socially and in the market; people and firms reward the providers of dangerously misleading information more than they reward truth tellers.  One of the lessons of the financial crisis that led to the Great Recession is that there are periods in which competition, among experts and among organizations, creates powerful forces that favor a collective blindness to risk and uncertainty. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The social and economic pressures that favor overconfidence are not  restricted to financial forecasting. Other professionals must deal with the fact that  an expert worthy of the name is expected to display high confidence. Philip Tetlock observed that the most overconfident experts were the most likely to be invited to strut their stuff in news shows. Overconfidence also appears to be endemic in medicine. A study of patients who died in the ICU compared autopsy results with the diagnosis that physicians had provided while the patients were still  alive. Physicians also reported their confidence. The result: “clinicians who were ‘completely certain’ of the  diagnosis antemortem  were wrong 40% of the time.” Here again, expert overconfidence is encouraged by their clients: “Generally, it is considered a weakness and a sign of vulnerability for clinicians to appear unsure. Confidence is valued over uncertainty and there is a prevailing censure  against  disclosing uncertainty to patients .” Experts who acknowledge the full extent of their ignorance may expect to be replaced by more confident competitors, who are better able to gain the trust of clients. An unbiased appreciation of uncertainty is a cornerstone of rationality—but it is not what people and organizations want. Extreme uncertainty is paralyzing under dangerous circumstances,  and the admission that one is merely guessing is especially unacceptable when the stakes are high. Acting on pretended knowledge is often the preferred solution. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The effects of high optimism on decision making are, at best, a mixed blessing, but the contribution of optimism to good implementation  is certainly positive. The main benefit of optimism is resilience in the face of setbacks. According to Martin Seligman, the founder of positive psychology, an “optimistic explanation style” contributes to resilience by defending one’s self-image. In essence, the optimistic style involves taking credit for successes but little blame for failures. This style can be taught, at least to some  extent, and Seligman has documented the effects of training on various occupations that are characterized by a high rate of failures, such as cold-call sales of insurance (a common pursuit in pre-Internet days). When one has just  had a door slammed in one’s face by an angry homemaker, the thought that “she was an awful woman” is clearly superior to “I am an inept salesperson.” I have always believed  that scientific research is another domain where a form of optimism is essential to success: I have yet to meet a successful scientist who lacks the ability to exaggerate the importance of what he or she is doing, and I believe that someone who lacks a delusional sense of significance will wilt in the face of repeated experiences of multiple small failures and rare successes, the fate of most  researchers. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Can overconfident optimism be overcome by training? I am not optimistic. There have been numerous attempts to train people to state confidence intervals that reflect the imprecision of their judgments, with only a few reports of modest success. An often cited example is that geologists at  Royal Dutch Shell  became less overconfident in their assessments  of possible drilling sites after training with multiple past cases for which the outcome was known. In other situations, overconfidence was mitigated (but not eliminated) when judges were encouraged to consider competing hypotheses. However, overconfidence is a direct consequence of features of System 1 that can be tamed—but not vanquished. The main obstacle is that subjective confidence is determined  by the coherence of the story one has constructed, not by the quality and amount of the information that supports it. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Organizations may be better able to tame optimism and individuals than individuals are. The best idea for doing so was contributed by Gary Klein, my “adversarial collaborator” who generally defends intuitive decision making against claims of bias and is typically hostile to algorithms.  He labels his proposal the  premortem . The procedure is simple: when the organization has almost come to an important decision but has not formally committed itself, Klein proposes gathering for a brief session a group of individuals who are knowledgeable about the decision. The premise of the session is a short speech: “Imagine that we are a year into the future. We implemented the plan as it  now exists. The outcome was a disaster. Please take 5 to 10 minutes to write a brief history of that disaster.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> As a team converges on a decision—and especially when the leader tips her hand—public doubts about the wisdom of the planned move are gradually suppressed and eventually come  to be treated as evidence of flawed loyalty to the team and its leaders. The suppression of doubt contributes to overconfidence in a group where only supporters of the decision have a voice. The main virtue of the premortem is that it legitimizes doubts. Furthermore, it encourages even supporters of the decision to search for possible threats that they had not considered earlier.

Every significant choice we make in life comes with some uncertainty—which is why students of decision making hope that some of the lessons learned in the model situation will be applicable to more interesting everyday problems.

Most important, our model was purely descriptive, and its goal was to document and explain systematic violations of the axioms of rationality in choices between gambles. We submitted our essay to  Econometrica , a journal that publishes significant theoretical articles in economics and in decision theory. The choice of venue turned out to be important; if we had published the identical paper in a psychological journal, it would likely have had little impact on economics. However, our decision was not guided by a wish to influence economics;  Econometrica  just happened to be where the best papers on decision  making had been published in the past, and we were aspiring to be in that company. In this choice as in many others, we were lucky. Prospect theory turned out to be the most significant work we ever did, and our article is among the most often cited in the social sciences. Two years later, we published in  Science  an account of framing effects:  the large changes of preferences that are sometimes  caused by inconsequential variations in the wording of a choice problem. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Our approach to the problem was in the spirit of a field of psychology called psychophysics, which was founded and named by the German psychologist and mystic Gustav Fechner (1801–1887). Fechner was obsessed with the relation of mind and matter. On one side there is a physical quantity that can vary, such  as the energy of a light, the frequency of a tone, or an amount of money. On the other side there is a subjective experience of brightness, pitch, or value. Mysteriously, variations of the physical quantity cause variations in the intensity or quality of the subjective experience. Fechner’s project was to find the psychophysical laws that relate the subjective quantity in the observer’s mind to the  objective quantity in the material world. He proposed that for many dimensions, the function is logarithmic—which simply means that an increase of stimulus intensity by a given factor (say, times 1.5 or times 10) always yields the same increment on the psychological scale. If raising the energy of the sound from 10 to 100 units of physical energy increases psychological intensity by 4 units, then  a further increase of stimulus intensity from 100 to 1,000 will also increase psychological intensity by 4 units. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> As Fechner well knew, he was not the first to look for a function that relates psychological intensity to the physical magnitude of the stimulus. In 1738, the Swiss scientist Daniel Bernoulli anticipated Fechner’s reasoning and applied it to the relationship between  the psychological value or desirability of money (now called  utility ) and the actual amount of money. He argued that a gift of 10 ducats has the same utility to someone who already has 100 ducats as a gift of 20 ducats to someone whose current wealth is 200 ducats. Bernoulli was right, of course: we normally speak of changes of income in terms of percentages, as when we say “she got a 30% raise.”  The idea is that a 30% raise may evoke a fairly similar psychological response  for the rich and for the poor , which an increase of $100 will not do. As in Fechner’s law,  the psychological response to a change of wealth is inversely proportional to the initial amount of wealth, leading to the conclusion that utility is a logarithmic function of wealth. If this function is accurate, the same psychological  distance separates $100,000 from $1 million, and  $10 million from $100 million . </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 正如费希纳所知道的，他并不是第一个寻找将心理强度与刺激的物理大小联系起来的函数。1738年，瑞士科学家丹尼尔-伯努利预见到了费希纳的推理，并将其应用于  ，即货币的心理价值或可取性（现在称为 效用 ）与货币的实际数量之间的关系。他认为，10个金币的礼物对一个已经拥有100个金币的人来说，与20个金币的礼物对一个目前财富为200个金币的人来说，具有相同的效用。当然，伯努利是对的：我们通常用百分比来谈论收入的变化，如我们说 "她加薪30%"。  这个想法是，加薪30%可能会唤起 富人和穷人 相当相似的心理反应，而增加100美元则不会。正如费希纳定律， ，对财富变化的心理反应与最初的财富数量成反比，从而得出结论，效用是财富的对数函数。如果这个函数是准确的，同样的心理  距离将10万美元与100万美元分开， 1000万美元与1亿美元分开 。 </p></div>

In fact a risk-averse decision  maker will choose a sure thing that is less than expected value, in effect paying a premium to avoid the uncertainty. One hundred years before Fechner, Bernoulli invented psychophysics to explain this aversion to risk. His idea was straightforward: people’s choices are based not on dollar values but on the psychological values of outcomes, their utilities. The psychological value of a gamble is  therefore not the weighted average of its possible dollar outcomes; it is the average of the utilities of these outcomes, each weighted by its probability. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Table 3  shows a version of the utility function that Bernoulli calculated; it presents the utility of different levels  of wealth, from 1 million to 10 million. You can see that adding 1 million to a wealth of 1 million yields an  increment of 30 utility points, but adding 1 million to a wealth of 9 million increment of 20 utility points, but adding 1 million to a wealth of 9 million adds only 4 points. Bernoulli proposed that the diminishing marginal value of wealth (in the modern jargon) is what explains risk  aversion—the common preference that people generally show for a sure thing over a favorable gamble of equal or slightly higher expected value.

<p class ="en"> The expected value of the gamble and the “sure thing” are equal in ducats (4 million), but the psychological  utilities of the two options are different, because of the diminishing utility of wealth: the increment of utility from 1 million to 4 million is 60 units, but an equal increment, from 4 to 7 million, increases the utility of wealth by only 24 units. The utility of the gamble is 84/2 = 42 (the utility of its two outcomes, each weighted by its probability of 1/2). The utility of 4 million is 60.  Because 60 is more than 42, an individual with this utility function will prefer the sure thing. Bernoulli’s insight was that a decision maker with diminishing marginal utility for wealth will be risk averse. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Bernoulli’s essay is a marvel of concise brilliance. He applied his new concept of expected utility (which he called “moral expectation”) to compute how much a merchant in St. Petersburg  would be willing to pay to insure a shipment of spice from Amsterdam if “he is well aware of the fact that at this time of year of one hundred ships which sail from Amsterdam to Petersburg, five are usually lost.” His utility function explained why poor people buy insurance and why richer people sell it to them. As you can see in the table, the loss of 1 million causes a loss of 4 points of utility  (from 100 to 96) to someone who has 10 million and a much larger loss of 18 points (from 48 to 30) to someone who starts off with 3 million. The poorer man will happily pay a premium to transfer the risk to the richer one, which is what insurance is about. Bernoulli also offered a solution to the famous  “St. Petersburg paradox,”  in which people who are offered a gamble that has infinite expected  value (in ducats) are willing to spend only a few ducats for it. Most impressive, his analysis of risk attitudes in terms of preferences for wealth has stood the test of time: it is still current in economic analysis almost 300 years later. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 伯努利的文章是一个简明辉煌的奇迹。他运用他的预期效用的新概念（他称之为 "道德期望"）来计算，如果 "他很清楚在每年的这个时候，从阿姆斯特丹开往彼得堡的一百艘船中，通常有五艘会丢失"，那么圣彼得堡的商人  ，愿意为来自阿姆斯特丹的一批香料支付多少保险。他的效用函数解释了为什么穷人要买保险，为什么富人要把保险卖给他们。正如你在表中看到的，损失100万会使拥有1000万的人损失4个点的效用  （从100到96），而对开始拥有300万的人来说，损失更大，达18个点（从48到30）。穷人会很高兴地支付保险费，将风险转移给更富有的人，这就是保险的意义。 伯努利还为著名的 "圣彼得堡悖论 " 提供了一个解决方案，即人们在得到一个具有无限预期  价值（以杜卡为单位）的赌博时，只愿意为其花费几个杜卡。最令人印象深刻的是，他在财富偏好方面对风险态度的分析经受住了时间的考验：几乎在300年后的今天，它仍然是经济分析中的主流。 </p></div>

I call it theory-induced blindness: once you have accepted a theory  and used it as a tool in your thinking, it is extraordinarily difficult to notice its flaws. If you come upon an observation that does not seem to fit the model, you assume that there must be a perfectly good explanation that you are somehow missing. You give the theory the benefit of the doubt, trusting the community of experts who have accepted it. Many scholars have surely thought at one time  or another of stories such as those of Anthony and Betty, or Jack and Jill, and casually noted that these stories did not jibe with utility theory. But they did not pursue the idea to the point of saying, “This theory is seriously wrong because it ignores the fact that utility depends on the  history of one’s wealth , not only on present wealth.” As the psychologist Daniel Gilbert observed, disbelieving  is hard work, and System 2 is easily tired. </p></div>

At Amos’s suggestion, I read a chapter in his book that described experiments in which distinguished scholars  had measured the utility of money by asking people to make choices about gambles in which the participant could win or lose a few pennies. The experimenters were measuring the utility of wealth, by modifying wealth within a range of less than a dollar. This raised questions. Is it plausible to assume that people evaluate the gambles by tiny differences in wealth? How could one hope to learn  about the psychophysics of wealth by studying reactions to gains and losses of pennies? Recent developments in psychophysical theory suggested that if you want to study the  subjective value of wealth , you should ask direct questions about wealth, not about changes of wealth. I did not know enough about utility theory to be blinded by respect for it, and I was puzzled. </p></div>

He remembered that the economist Harry Markowitz, who would later earn the Nobel Prize for his work on  finance, had proposed a theory in which utilities were attached to changes of wealth rather than to states of wealth. Markowitz’s idea had been around for a  quarter of a century and had not attracted much attention, but we quickly concluded that this was the way to go, and that the theory we were planning to develop would define outcomes as gains and losses, not as states of wealth.

<p class ="en"> In utility theory, the utility of a gain is assessed by comparing the utilities of two states of wealth.  For example, the utility of getting an extra $500 when your wealth is $1 million is the difference between the utility of $1,000,500 and the utility of $1 million. And if you own the larger amount, the disutility of losing $500 is again the difference between the utilities of the two states of wealth. In this theory, the utilities of gains and losses are allowed to differ only in their sign  (+ or −). There is no way to represent the fact that the disutility of losing $500 could be greater than the utility of winning the same amount—though of course it is. As might be expected in a situation of theory-induced blindness, possible differences between gains and losses were neither expected nor studied.

The basic concepts of economics are essential intellectual tools, which are not easy to grasp even with simplified and unrealistic assumptions about the nature of the economic agents who interact in markets. Raising questions about these assumptions even as they are introduced would be confusing, and perhaps demoralizing. It is reasonable to put priority on helping students acquire  the basic tools of the discipline. Furthermore, the failure of rationality that is built into prospect theory is often irrelevant to the predictions of economic theory, which work out with great precision in some situations and provide good approximations in many others. In some contexts, however, the difference becomes significant: the Humans described by prospect theory are  guided by the immediate  emotional impact of gains and losses, not by long-term prospects of wealth and global utility. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Winning nothing is a possible outcome in all three gambles, and prospect theory assigns the same value to that outcome in the three cases. Winning nothing is the reference point and its value is zero. Do these statements correspond to your experience? Of course not. Winning nothing  is a nonevent in the first two cases, and assigning it a value of zero makes good sense. In contrast, failing to win in the third scenario is intensely disappointing. Like a salary increase that has been promised informally, the high probability of winning the large sum sets up a tentative new reference point. Relative to your expectations, winning nothing will be experienced as a large loss.  Prospect theory cannot cope with this fact, because it does not allow the value of an outcome (in this case, winning nothing) to change when it is highly unlikely, or when the alternative is very valuable. In simple words, prospect theory cannot deal with disappointment. Disappointment and the anticipation of disappointment are real, however, and the failure to acknowledge them is as obvious a  flaw as the counterexamples that I invoked to criticize Bernoulli’s theory. </p></div>

The convex shape indicates diminishing marginal utility: the more leisure you have, the less you care for an extra day of it, and each added day is worth less than the one before.

The role of loss aversion in bargaining is also well understood: making  concessions hurts. You have much  personal experience of the role of reference point. If you changed jobs or locations, or even considered such a change, you surely remember that the features of the new place were coded as pluses or minuses relative to where you were.

<p class ="en"> Professor R (now revealed to be Richard Rosett, who went on to become the dean of  the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business) was a firm believer in standard economic theory as well as a sophisticated wine lover. Thaler observed that Professor R was very reluctant to sell a bottle from his collection—even at the high price of $100 (in 1975 dollars!).  Professor R bought wine at auctions, but would never pay more than $35 for a bottle of that quality. At prices between  $35 and $100, he would neither buy nor sell. The large gap is inconsistent with economic theory, in which the professor is expected to have a single value for the bottle. If a particular bottle is worth $50 to him, then he should be willing to sell it for any amount in excess of $50. If he  did not own the bottle , he should be willing to pay any amount up to $50 for it. The just-acceptable selling  price and the just-acceptable buying price should have been identical, but in fact the minimum price to sell ($100) was much higher than the maximum buying price of $35. Owning the good appeared to increase its value. </p></div>

You can easily imagine yourself in a similar situation.  Suppose you hold a ticket to a sold-out concert by a popular band, which you bought at the regular price of $200. You are an avid fan and would have been willing to pay up to $500 for the ticket. Now you have your ticket and you learn on the Internet that richer or more desperate fans are offering $3,000. Would you sell? If you resemble most of the audience at sold-out events you do not sell.  Your lowest selling price is above $3,000 and your maximum buying price is $500.

<p class ="en"> Chance intervened when Thaler met one of our former students at a conference and obtained an early draft of prospect theory. He reports  that he read the manuscript with considerable excitement, because he quickly realized that the loss-averse value function of prospect theory could explain the endowment effect and some other puzzles in his collection. The solution was to abandon the standard idea that Professor R had a unique utility for the state of  having  a particular bottle. Prospect theory suggested that the willingness to  buy or sell the bottle depends on the reference point—whether or not the professor owns the bottle now. If he owns it, he considers the pain of  giving up  the bottle. If he does not own it, he considers the pleasure of  getting  the bottle. The values were unequal because of loss aversion:  giving up a bottle of nice wine  is more painful than getting an equally good bottle is pleasurable. Remember  the graph of losses and gains in the previous chapter. The slope of the function is steeper in the negative domain; the response to a loss is stronger than the response to a corresponding gain. This was the explanation of the endowment effect that Thaler had been searching for. And the first application of prospect theory to an economic  puzzle now appears to have been a significant milestone in  the development of behavioral economics. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The starting point for our investigation was that  the endowment effect is not universal. If someone asks you to change a $5 bill for five singles, you hand over the five ones without any sense of loss. Nor is there much loss aversion when you shop for shoes. The merchant who gives up the shoes in exchange for money certainly feels no loss. Indeed, the shoes that he hands over have always been, from his point of view, a cumbersome proxy for money  that he was hoping to collect from some consumer. Furthermore, you probably do not experience paying the merchant as a loss, because you were effectively holding money as a proxy for the shoes you intended to buy. These cases of routine trading are not essentially different from the exchange of a $5 bill for five singles. There is no loss aversion on either side of routine commercial exchanges. </p></div>

We borrowed one aspect of the design of our experiment from  Vernon Smith, the founder of experimental economics, with whom I would share a Nobel Prize many years later. In this method, a limited number of tokens are distributed to the participants in a “market.” Any participants who own a token at the end of the experiment can redeem it for cash. The redemption values  differ for different individuals, to represent the fact that the goods traded in markets  are more valuable to some people than to others. The same token may be worth $10 to you and $20 to me, and an exchange at any price between these values will be advantageous to both of us. </p></div>

Then we conducted a similar market for an object that we expected people to value for use: an attractive coffee mug, decorated with the university insignia of wherever we were conducting the experiments.

The Sellers had their mug in front of them,  and the Buyers were invited to look at their neighbor’s mug; all indicated the price at which they would trade. The Buyers had to use their own money to acquire a mug.

<p class ="en"> The concept of loss aversion is certainly the most significant contribution of psychology to behavioral economics. This is odd, because the idea that people evaluate many outcomes as gains and losses, and that losses  loom larger than gains, surprises no one. Amos and I often joked that we were engaged in studying a subject about which our grandmothers knew a great deal. In fact, however, we know more than our grandmothers did and can now embed loss aversion in the context of a broader two-systems model of the mind, and specifically a biological and psychological view in which negativity and escape dominate positivity  and approach. We can also trace the consequences of loss aversion in surprisingly diverse observations: only out-of-pocket losses are compensated when goods are lost in transport; attempts at large-scale reforms very often fail; and professional golfers putt more accurately for par than for a birdie. Clever as she was, my grandmother would have been surprised by the specific predictions from  a general idea she considered obvious. </p></div>

After some time you may have recognized the eyes of a terrified person. The eyes on the right, narrowed by the raised cheeks of a smile, express happiness—and they are not nearly as exciting. The two pictures were presented to people lying in a  brain scanner. Each picture was shown for less than  2 ⁄ 100  of a second and immediately masked by “visual noise,” a random display of dark and bright squares. None of the observers ever consciously knew that he had seen pictures of eyes, but one part of their brain evidently knew: the amygdala, which has a primary role as the “threat center” of the brain, although it is also activated in other emotional  states. Images of the brain showed an intense response of the amygdala to a threatening picture that the viewer did not recognize. The information about the threat probably traveled via a superfast neural channel that feeds directly into a part of the brain that processes emotions,  bypassing the visual cortex  that supports the conscious experience of “seeing.” The same circuit also causes schematic  angry faces (a potential threat) to be  processed faster  and more efficiently than schematic happy faces. Some experimenters have reported that an angry face  “pops out”  of a crowd of happy faces, but a single happy face does not stand out in an angry crowd. The brains of humans and other animals contain a mechanism that is designed to give priority to bad news. By shaving a few hundredths of a  second from the time needed to detect a predator, this circuit improves the animal’s odds of living long enough to reproduce. The automatic operations of System 1 reflect this evolutionary history. No comparably rapid mechanism for recognizing good news has been detected. Of course, we and our animal cousins are quickly alerted to signs of opportunities to mate or to feed, and advertisers design billboards  accordingly. Still, threats are privileged above opportunities, as they should be. </p></div>

As we saw earlier  with the word  vomit , the symbolic representation associatively evokes in attenuated form many of the reactions to the real thing, including physiological indices of emotion and even fractional tendencies to avoid or approach, recoil or lean forward. The sensitivity to threats extends to the processing of statements of opinions with which we strongly disagree.

As he points  out, the negative trumps the positive in many ways, and loss aversion is one of many manifestations of a broad  negativity dominance . Other scholars, in a paper titled “Bad Is Stronger Than Good,” summarized the evidence as follows: “Bad emotions, bad parents, and bad feedback have more impact than good ones, and bad information is processed more thoroughly than good. The self is more motivated  to avoid bad self-definitions than to pursue good ones. Bad impressions and bad stereotypes are quicker to form and more  resistant to disconfirmation  than good ones.” They cite John Gottman, the well-known expert in marital relations, who observed that the long-term success of a relationship depends far more on avoiding the negative than on seeking the positive. Gottman estimated that a stable  relationship requires that good interactions outnumber bad interactions by at least 5 to 1. Other asymmetries in the social domain are even more striking. We all know that a friendship that may take years to develop can be ruined by a single action. </p></div>

They are likely to reduce their efforts when they have reached an immediate goal, with results that sometimes violate economic logic. New York cabdrivers, for example, may have  a target income for the month or the year, but the goal that controls their effort is typically a daily target of earnings. Of course, the daily goal is much easier to achieve (and exceed) on some days than on others. On rainy days, a New York cab never remains free for long, and the driver quickly achieves his target; not so in pleasant weather, when cabs often waste time cruising the streets  looking for fares. Economic logic implies that cabdrivers should work many hours on rainy days and treat themselves to some leisure on mild days, when they can “buy” leisure at a lower price. The logic of loss aversion suggests the opposite: drivers who have a fixed daily target will work many more hours when the pickings are slim and go home early when  rain-drenched customers  are begging to be  taken somewhere. </p></div>

It is an  ever-present feature of negotiations, especially of renegotiations of an existing contract, the typical situation in labor negotiations and in international discussions of trade or arms limitations. The existing terms define reference points, and a proposed change in any aspect of the agreement is inevitably viewed as a concession that one side makes to the other. Loss aversion creates an asymmetry  that makes agreements difficult to reach. The concessions you make to me are my gains, but they are your losses; they cause you much more pain than they give me pleasure. Inevitably, you will place a higher value on them than I do. The same is true, of course, of the very painful concessions you demand from me, which you do not appear to value sufficiently!

<p class ="en"> Animals,  including people, fight harder to prevent losses than to achieve gains. In the world of territorial animals, this principle explains the success of defenders. A biologist observed that “when a territory holder is challenged by a rival, the owner almost always  wins the contest —usually within a matter of seconds.” In human affairs, the same simple rule explains much of what happens when institutions  attempt to reform themselves, in “reorganizations” and “restructuring” of companies, and in efforts to rationalize a bureaucracy, simplify the tax code, or reduce medical costs. As initially conceived, plans for reform almost always produce many winners and some losers while achieving an overall improvement. If the affected parties have any political influence, however, potential losers will  be more active and determined than potential winners; the outcome will be biased in their favor and inevitably more expensive and less effective than initially planned. Reforms commonly include grandfather clauses that protect current stakeholders—for example, when the existing workforce is reduced by attrition rather than by dismissals, or when cuts in salaries and benefits apply only to future workers.  Loss aversion is a powerful conservative force that favors minimal changes from the status quo in the lives of both institutions and individuals. This conservatism helps keep us stable in our neighborhood, our marriage, and our job; it is the gravitational force that holds our life together near the reference point. </p></div>

The Canadian government’s Department of Fisheries and Oceans had a program for unemployed professionals in Toronto, who were paid to administer  telephone surveys. The large team of interviewers worked every night and new questions were constantly needed to keep the operation going. Through Jack Knetsch, we agreed to generate a questionnaire  every week, in four color-labeled versions. We could ask about anything; the only constraint was that the questionnaire should include at least one mention of fish, to make it pertinent to the mission  of the department. This went on for many months, and we treated ourselves to an orgy of data collection. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 在我们在温哥华一起工作的一年里，  Richard Thaler、Jack Knetsch和我被吸引到一项关于经济交易公平性的研究中，部分原因是我们对这个话题感兴趣，但也因为我们有机会以及有义务每周编造一份新的问卷调查。加拿大政府的渔业和海洋部有一个针对多伦多的失业专业人员的项目，他们有报酬地管理  电话调查。这支庞大的调查员队伍每天晚上都在工作，不断需要新的问题来维持运作。通过Jack Knetsch，我们同意每周生成一份问卷 ，有四个彩色标签的版本。我们可以问任何问题；唯一的限制是，问卷中至少要有一处提到鱼，以使其与该部门的任务相关  。这种情况持续了好几个月，我们对自己进行了一次数据收集的狂欢。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> We studied public perceptions of what constitutes unfair behavior on the part of  merchants, employers, and landlords . Our overarching question was whether the opprobrium attached to unfairness imposes constraints on profit seeking. We found that it does. We also found that the moral rules  by which the public evaluates what firms may or may not do draw a crucial distinction between losses and gains. The basic principle is that the existing wage, price, or rent sets a reference point, which has the nature of an entitlement that must not be infringed. It is considered unfair for the firm to impose losses on its customers or workers relative to the reference transaction, unless it must  do so to protect its own entitlement. Consider this example: </p></div>

A basic rule of fairness, we found, is that the exploitation of market power to impose losses on others is unacceptable.

When a firm faced lower production costs, the rules of fairness did not require it to share the bonanza with either its customers or its workers.

They showed indignation  only when a firm exploited its power to break informal contracts with workers or customers, and to impose a loss on others in order to increase its profit.

<p class ="en"> We were not optimistic when we submitted our  report of this research to the  American Economic Review . Our article challenged what was then accepted wisdom among many economists that economic behavior is ruled by self-interest and that concerns for fairness are generally irrelevant. We also relied on the evidence of survey responses, for which economists generally have little respect. However, the editor of the journal sent our article  for  evaluation to two economists who were not bound by those conventions (we later learned their identity; they were the most friendly the editor could have found). The editor made the correct call. The article is often cited, and its conclusions have stood the test of time. More recent research has supported the observations of reference-dependent fairness and has also shown that  fairness concerns are economically significant , a fact we had suspected but did not prove. Employers who violate rules of fairness are punished by reduced productivity, and merchants who follow unfair pricing policies can expect to lose sales. People who learned from a new catalog that the merchant was now charging less for a product that they had recently bought at a higher price reduced their future purchases from  that supplier by 15%, an average loss of $90 per customer. The customers evidently perceived the lower price as the reference point and thought of themselves as having sustained a loss by paying more than appropriate. Moreover, the customers who reacted the most strongly were those who bought more items and at higher prices. The losses far exceeded the gains from the increased purchases produced  by the lower prices in the new catalog. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Unfairly imposing losses on people can be risky if the victims are in a position to retaliate. Furthermore, experiments have shown that strangers who observe unfair behavior often join in the punishment. Neuroeconomists (scientists who combine economics with brain research) have used MRI machines to examine the brains of people who are engaged in punishing  one stranger for behaving unfairly to another stranger. Remarkably,  altruistic punishment is accompanied  by increased activity in the “pleasure centers” of the brain. It appears that maintaining the social order and the rules of fairness in this fashion is its own reward. Altruistic punishment could well be the glue that holds societies together. However, our brains are not designed to reward  generosity as reliably as they punish meanness. Here again, we find a marked asymmetry between losses and gains. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The influence of loss aversion and entitlements extends far beyond the realm of financial transactions. Jurists were quick to recognize their impact on the law and in the administration of justice. In one study, David Cohen and Jack Knetsch found many examples of a sharp distinction  between  actual losses and foregone gains  in legal decisions. For example, a merchant whose goods were lost in transit may be compensated for costs he actually incurred, but is unlikely to be compensated for lost profits. The familiar rule that possession is nine-tenths of the law confirms the moral status of the reference point. In a more recent discussion, Eyal Zamir makes the provocative point  that the distinction drawn in the law between restoring losses  and compensating for foregone gains may be justified by their  asymmetrical effects on individual well-being . If people who lose suffer more than people who merely fail to gain, they may also deserve more protection from the law. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Whenever you form a global evaluation of a complex object—a car you may buy, your son-in-law, or an uncertain situation—you assign weights to its characteristics. This is simply a cumbersome way of saying that  some characteristics influence your assessment more than others do. The weighting occurs whether or not you are aware of it; it is an operation of System 1. Your overall evaluation of a car may put more or less weight on gas economy, comfort, or appearance. Your judgment of your son-in-law may depend more or less on how rich or handsome or reliable he is. Similarly, your assessment of an uncertain  prospect assigns weights to the possible outcomes. The weights are certainly correlated with the probabilities of these outcomes: a 50% chance to win a million is much more attractive than a 1% chance to win the same amount. The assignment of weights is sometimes conscious and deliberate. Most often, however, you are just an observer to a global evaluation that your System 1 delivers. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> One reason for the popularity of the gambling metaphor in the study of decision making is that it provides a natural rule for the assignment of weights to the outcomes of a prospect: the more probable an outcome, the more weight it should have. The expected value of a gamble is the average of its outcomes, each weighted by its probability. For example, the expected value of “20% chance  to win $1,000 and 75% chance to win $100” is $275.  In the pre-Bernoulli days, gambles were assessed by their expected value. Bernoulli retained this method for assigning weights to the outcomes, which is known as the expectation principle, but applied it to the psychological value of the outcomes. The utility of a gamble, in his theory, is the average of the utilities of its outcomes, each weighted  by its probability. </p></div>

This was the main point of the axiomatic version of utility theory that von Neumann and Morgenstern introduced in 1944. They proved that any weighting of uncertain outcomes that is not strictly proportional to probability leads to inconsistencies  and other disasters . Their derivation of the expectation principle from axioms of rational choice was immediately recognized  as a monumental achievement, which placed expected utility theory at the core of the rational agent model in economics and other social sciences.

So you started in the  first problem with a preference for the left-hand urn, which was then improved more than the right-hand urn—but now you like the one on the right! This pattern of choices does not make logical sense, but a psychological explanation is readily  available: the certainty effect is at work.

However, decision weights depart sharply from probabilities near these points. At the low end, we find the possibility effect: unlikely events are considerably overweighted. For  example, the decision weight that corresponds to a 2% chance is 8.1. If people conformed to the axioms of rational choice, the decision weight would be 2—so the rare event is overweighted by a factor of 4.

The anxiety of the second situation appears to be more salient than the hope in  the first.

You can see that the range of probabilities between 5% and 95% is associated with a much smaller range of decision weights (from 13.2 to 79.3), about two-thirds as much as rationally expected. Neuroscientists have confirmed these observations, finding regions of the brain that respond to changes in  the probability of winning a prize.

On the other hand, when you do not ignore  the very rare events, you will certainly overweight them. Most of us spend very little time worrying about nuclear meltdowns or fantasizing about large inheritances from unknown relatives. However, when an unlikely event becomes the focus of attention, we will assign it much more weight than its probability deserves. Furthermore, people  are almost completely insensitive to variations of risk among small probabilities. A cancer risk of 0.001% is not easily distinguished from a risk of 0.00001%, although the former would translate to 3,000 cancers for the population of the United States, and the latter to 30. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> First, there is diminishing sensitivity. The sure loss is very aversive because the reaction to a loss of $900 is more than 90% as intense as the reaction to a loss of $1,000. The second factor may  be even more powerful: the decision weight that corresponds to a probability of 90% is only about 71, much lower than the probability. The result is that when you consider a choice between a sure loss and a gamble with a high probability of a larger loss, diminishing sensitivity makes the sure loss more aversive, and the certainty effect reduces the aversiveness of the gamble. The same two factors  enhance the attractiveness of the sure thing and reduce the attractiveness of the gamble when the outcomes are positive. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The legal scholar Chris Guthrie has offered a compelling application of the fourfold pattern to two situations in which the plaintiff and the defendant in a civil suit consider a possible settlement.  The situations differ in the strength of the plaintiff’s case. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 法律学者克里斯-格思里(Chris Guthrie)将四重模式令人信服地应用于民事诉讼中原告和被告考虑可能和解的两种情况。  这两种情况在原告案件的力度上有所不同。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> As in a scenario we saw earlier, you are the plaintiff in a civil suit in which you have made a claim for a large sum in damages. The trial is going very well and your lawyer cites expert opinion that you have a 95% chance to win outright, but adds the caution, “You never really know the outcome until the jury comes in.” Your lawyer  urges you to accept a settlement in which you might get only 90% of your claim. You are in the top left cell of the fourfold pattern, and the question on your mind is, “Am I willing to take even a small chance of getting nothing at all? Even 90% of the claim is a great deal of money, and I can walk away with it now.” Two emotions are evoked, both driving in the same direction: the attraction of  a sure (and substantial) gain and the fear of intense disappointment and regret if you reject a settlement and lose in court. You can feel the pressure that typically leads to cautious behavior in this situation. The plaintiff with a strong case is likely to be risk averse. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 就像我们之前看到的一个场景，你是一个民事诉讼的原告，你提出了巨额赔偿的要求。审判进行得非常顺利，你的律师引用了专家的意见，认为你有95%的机会完全获胜，但又提醒说："在陪审团来之前，你永远不会真正知道结果。"你的律师  ，敦促你接受和解，你可能只得到90%的索赔。你处于四重模式的左上角，你心中的问题是："我是否愿意接受哪怕是一点都得不到的小机会？即使是90%的索赔额也是一笔大数目，而且我现在就可以拿着它离开。"两种情绪被唤起，都朝着同一个方向发展：  ，一个肯定的（和可观的）收益的吸引力，以及如果你拒绝和解并在法庭上败诉，对强烈的失望和遗憾的恐惧。你可以感受到在这种情况下通常会导致谨慎行为的压力。拥有强大案件的原告很可能会规避风险。 </p></div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Now step into the shoes of the defendant in the same case. Although you have not completely given up hope of a decision  in your favor, you realize that the trial is going poorly. The plaintiff’s lawyers have proposed a settlement in which you would have to pay 90% of their original claim, and it is clear they will not accept less. Will you settle, or will you pursue the case? Because you face a high probability of a loss, your situation belongs in the top right cell. The temptation to fight on is strong: the settlement  that the plaintiff has offered is almost as painful as the worst outcome you face, and there is still hope of prevailing in court. Here again, two emotions are  involved: the sure loss is repugnant and the possibility of winning in court is highly attractive. A defendant with a weak case is likely to be risk seeking, prepared to gamble rather than accept a very unfavorable settlement. In the face-off  between a risk-averse plaintiff and a risk-seeking defendant, the defendant holds the stronger hand. The superior bargaining position of the defendant should be reflected in negotiated settlements, with the plaintiff settling for less than the statistically expected outcome of the trial. This prediction from the fourfold pattern was confirmed by experiments conducted with law students and practicing  judges, and also by analyses of actual negotiations in the  shadow of civil trials . </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 现在站在同一案件的被告的立场上。虽然你还没有完全放弃对判决的希望，  ，但你意识到，审判的进展很不顺利。原告的律师提出了一个和解方案，你必须支付他们原始索赔的90%，显然他们不会接受更少的金额。你是要和解，还是要继续打官司？因为你面临的损失概率很高，你的情况属于右上角的单元格。继续打下去的诱惑力很强：原告提出的和解  ，几乎和你面临的最坏结果一样痛苦，而且还有希望在法庭上获胜。 这里又涉及到两种情绪：肯定的损失令人厌恶，而在法庭上获胜的可能性则极具吸引力。一个案件薄弱的被告可能会寻求风险，准备赌博而不是接受一个非常不利的和解。在规避风险的原告和寻求风险的被告之间的对峙中，  ，被告持有更强的手。被告的优势讨价还价地位应该反映在谈判的和解中，原告的和解金额低于统计学上的预期审判结果。对法律专业学生和执业  法官进行的实验，以及对 民事审判阴影下 的实际谈判的分析，都证实了这种来自四重模式的预测。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Now consider “frivolous litigation,” when a plaintiff with a flimsy case files a large claim that is most likely to fail in court. Both sides are aware of the probabilities, and both know that in a negotiated settlement the plaintiff will get only a small fraction of the amount of the claim. The negotiation is  conducted in the bottom row of the fourfold pattern. The plaintiff is in the left-hand cell, with a small chance to win a very large amount;  the frivolous claim  is a lottery ticket for a large prize. Overweighting the small chance of success is natural in this situation, leading the plaintiff to be bold and aggressive in the negotiation. For the defendant, the suit is a nuisance with a small risk  of a very bad outcome. Overweighting the small chance of a large loss favors risk aversion, and settling for a modest amount is equivalent to purchasing insurance against the unlikely event of a bad verdict. The shoe is now on the other foot: the plaintiff is willing to gamble and the defendant wants to be safe. Plaintiffs with frivolous claims are likely to obtain a more generous settlement than  the statistics of the situation justify. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 现在考虑一下 "无意义的诉讼"，当原告用一个不可靠的案件提出一个大的索赔，而这个索赔很可能在法庭上失败。双方都知道这种可能性，而且都知道在谈判解决中，原告将只得到索赔金额的一小部分。谈判是在四重模式的底排进行的  。原告在左边的单元格中，有很小的机会赢得很大的金额； 轻率的索赔 是一张获得巨额奖金的彩票。在这种情况下，过度重视小的成功机会是很自然的，导致原告在谈判中大胆而积极。对被告来说，诉讼是一种滋扰，风险小  ，结果非常糟糕。对大额损失的小概率的过度权衡有利于规避风险，以适度的金额和解相当于为不可能出现的糟糕判决购买保险。现在的情况是：原告愿意赌博，被告希望安全。提出轻率索赔的原告有可能获得比  ，情况的统计数字所证明的更慷慨的和解。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The decisions described by the fourfold pattern are not obviously unreasonable. You can empathize in each case with the feelings of the plaintiff and the defendant that lead them to adopt a combative or an accommodating posture. In the long run, however, deviations from expected value are likely to be costly. Consider a large organization, the City of  New York, and suppose it faces 200 “frivolous” suits each year, each with a 5% chance to cost the city $1 million. Suppose further that in each case the city could settle the lawsuit for a payment of $100,000. The city considers two alternative policies that it will apply to all such cases: settle or go to trial.

<p class ="en"> I visited Israel several times during a period in which suicide bombings in buses were relatively common—though of course quite rare in absolute terms. There were altogether 23 bombings between December 2001 and September  2004, which had caused a total of 236 fatalities. The number of daily bus riders in Israel was approximately 1.3 million at that time. For any traveler, the risks were tiny, but that was not how the public felt about it. People avoided buses as much as they could, and many travelers spent their time on the bus anxiously scanning their neighbors for packages or bulky clothes that might hide a  bomb. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> I did not have much occasion to travel on buses, as I was driving a rented car, but I was chagrined to discover that my behavior was also affected. I found that I did not like to stop next to a bus at a red light, and I drove away more quickly than usual when the light changed. I was ashamed of myself, because of course I knew better. I knew that the risk was truly negligible, and that  any effect at all on my actions would assign an inordinately high “decision weight” to a minuscule probability. In fact, I was more likely to be injured in a driving accident than by stopping near a bus. But my avoidance of buses was not motivated by a rational concern for survival. What drove me was the experience of the moment: being next to a bus made me think of bombs, and these thoughts were  unpleasant. I was avoiding buses because I wanted to think of something else. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> My experience illustrates how terrorism works and why it is so effective: it induces an availability cascade. An extremely vivid image of death and  damage, constantly reinforced by media attention and frequent conversations, becomes highly accessible, especially if it is associated with a specific situation such as  the sight of a bus. The emotional arousal is associative, automatic, and uncontrolled, and it produces an impulse for protective action. System 2 may “know” that the probability is low, but this knowledge does not eliminate the self-generated discomfort and the  wish to avoid it . System 1 cannot be turned off. The emotion is not only disproportionate to the probability, it is also insensitive to  the exact level of probability. Suppose that two cities have been warned about the presence of suicide bombers. Residents of one city are told that two bombers are ready to strike. Residents of another city are told of a single bomber. Their risk is lower by half, but do they feel much safer? </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Many stores in New York City sell lottery tickets, and business is good. The psychology of high-prize  lotteries is similar to the psychology of terrorism. The thrilling possibility of winning the big prize is shared by the community and reinforced by conversations at work and at home. Buying a ticket is immediately rewarded by pleasant fantasies, just as avoiding a bus was immediately rewarded by relief from fear. In both cases, the actual probability is inconsequential; only possibility matters.  The original formulation of prospect theory included the argument that “highly unlikely events are either ignored or overweighted,” but it did not specify the conditions under which one or the other will occur, nor did it propose a psychological interpretation of it. My current view of decision weights has been strongly influenced by recent research on the role of emotions and  vividness in decision making . Overweighting of unlikely outcomes is rooted in System 1 features that are familiar by now. Emotion and vividness influence fluency, availability, and judgments of probability—and thus account for our excessive response to the few rare events that we do not ignore. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The probability of a rare event is most likely to be overestimated when the alternative is not fully specified. My favorite example comes from a study that the psychologist  Craig Fox conducted while he was  Amos’s student . Fox recruited fans of professional basketball and elicited several judgments and decisions concerning the winner of the NBA playoffs. In particular, he asked them to estimate the probability that each of the eight participating teams would win the playoff; the victory of each team in turn was the focal event. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> You can surely guess what happened,  but the magnitude of the effect that Fox observed may surprise you. Imagine a fan who has been asked to estimate the chances that the Chicago Bulls will win the tournament. The focal event is well defined, but its alternative—one of the other seven teams winning—is diffuse and less evocative. The fan’s memory and imagination, operating in confirmatory mode, are trying to construct a victory for the  Bulls. When the same person is next asked to assess the chances of the Lakers, the same selective activation will work in favor of that team. The eight best professional basketball teams in the United States are all very good, and it is possible to imagine even a relatively weak team among them emerging as champion. The result: the probability judgments generated successively for the eight teams  added up to 240%!

<p class ="en"> As we have seen, prospect theory differs from utility theory in the relationship it suggests between probability and decision weight. In utility theory, decision weights and probabilities are the same. The decision weight of a sure thing is 100, and the weight that corresponds to a 90% chance is exactly 90, which is 9 times more than the decision weight for a 10% chance. In prospect theory,  variations of probability have less effect on decision weights. An experiment that I mentioned earlier found that the decision weight for a 90% chance was 71.2 and the decision weight for a 10% chance was 18.6. The ratio of the probabilities was 9.0, but the ratio of the decision weights was only 3.83, indicating insufficient sensitivity to probability in that range. In both theories, the decision  weights depend only on probability, not on the outcome. Both theories predict that the decision weight for a 90% chance is the same for winning $100,  receiving a dozen roses , or getting an electric shock. This theoretical prediction turns out to be wrong. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 正如我们所看到的，前景理论与效用理论的不同之处在于它所提出的概率与决策权重之间的关系。在效用理论中，决策权重和概率是一样的。一个确定的事情的决策权重是100，而对应于90%的机会的权重正好是90，是10%的机会的决策权重的9倍。在前景理论中，  ，概率的变化对决策权重的影响较小。我之前提到的一个实验发现，90%的机会的决策权重是71.2，10%的机会的决策权重是18.6。概率之比为9.0，但决策权重之比仅为3.83，表明在该范围内对概率的敏感性不足。在这两个理论中，决策  权重只取决于概率，而不取决于结果。两种理论都预测，对于赢得100美元、 收到一打玫瑰花 或受到电击，90%的机会的决策权重是相同的。这个理论预测结果是错误的。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Psychologists at the University of Chicago published an article with the attractive title “Money, Kisses, and Electric Shocks: On the Affective  Psychology of Risk.” Their finding was that the valuation of gambles was much less sensitive to probability when the (fictitious) outcomes were emotional (“meeting and kissing your favorite movie star” or “getting a painful, but not dangerous, electric shock”) than when the outcomes were gains or losses of cash. This was not an isolated finding. Other researchers had found, using physiological  measures such as heart rate, that the fear of an impending electric shock was essentially uncorrelated with the probability of receiving the shock. The mere possibility of a shock triggered the full-blown fear response. The Chicago team proposed that “affect-laden imagery” overwhelmed the response to probability. Ten years later, a team of psychologists at Princeton challenged that conclusion. </p></div>

Vivid imagery contributes to denominator neglect, at least as I experience it. When I think of the small urn, I see a single red marble on a vaguely defined background of white marbles. When I think of the larger urn, I see eight winning red marbles on an indistinct background of white marbles, which creates a more hopeful feeling. The distinctive  vividness of the winning marbles increases the decision weight of that event, enhancing the possibility effect. Of course, the same will be true of the certainty effect. If I have a 90% chance of winning a prize, the event of not winning will be more salient if 10 of 100 marbles are “losers” than if 1 of 10 marbles yields the same outcome. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The idea of denominator neglect helps explain why different  ways of communicating risks vary so much in their effects. You read that “a vaccine that protects children from a fatal disease carries a 0.001% risk of permanent disability.” The risk appears small. Now consider another description of the same risk: “One of 100,000 vaccinated children will be permanently disabled.” The second statement does something to your mind that the first does not: it  calls up the image of an individual child who is permanently disabled by a vaccine; the 99,999 safely vaccinated children have faded into the background. As predicted by denominator neglect, low-probability events are much more heavily weighted when described in terms of relative frequencies (how many) than when stated in more abstract terms of “chances,” “risk,” or “probability” (how likely). As  we have seen, System 1 is much better at dealing with individuals than categories. </p></div>

There are exceptions, of course, in which focusing on an event does not raise its  probability: cases in which an erroneous theory makes an event appear impossible even when you think about it, or cases in which an inability to imagine how an outcome might come about leaves you convinced that it will not happen. The bias toward overestimation and overweighting of salient events is not an absolute rule, but it is large and robust. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> There has been much interest in recent years  in  studies of  choice from experience , which follow different rules from the  choices from description  that are analyzed in prospect theory. Participants in a typical experiment face two buttons. When pressed, each button produces either a monetary reward or nothing, and the outcome is drawn randomly according to the specifications of a prospect (for example, “5% to win $12” or “95% chance to win  $1”). The process is truly random, so there is no guarantee that the sample a participant sees exactly represents the statistical setup. The expected values associated with the two buttons are approximately equal, but one is riskier (more variable) than the other. (For example, one button may produce $10 on 5% of the trials and the other $1 on 50% of the trials). Choice from experience is implemented  by exposing the participant to many trials in which she can observe the consequences of pressing one button or another. On the critical trial, she chooses one of the two buttons, and she earns the outcome on that trial. Choice from description is realized by showing the subject the verbal description of the risky prospect associated with each button (such as “5% to win $12”) and asking her to  choose one. As expected from prospect theory, choice from description yields a possibility effect—rare outcomes are overweighted relative to their probability. In sharp contrast, overweighting is never observed in choice from experience, and underweighting is common. </p></div>

The probability of a rare event will (often, not always) be overestimated, because of the confirmatory bias of memory. Thinking about that event, you try to make it true in your mind. A rare event will be overweighted if it specifically attracts attention. Separate attention is effectively guaranteed when prospects are described explicitly (“99% chance to win $1,000, and 1% chance to  win nothing”). Obsessive concerns (the bus in Jerusalem), vivid images (the roses), concrete representations (1 of 1,000), and explicit reminders (as in choice from description) all contribute to overweighting. And when there is no overweighting, there will be neglect. When it comes to rare probabilities, our mind is not designed to get things quite right.

</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> The great Paul Samuelson—a giant among the economists of the twentieth century—famously asked a friend whether he would  accept a gamble on the toss of a coin in which he could lose $100 or win $200. His friend responded, “I won’t bet because I would feel the $100 loss more than the $200 gain. But I’ll take you on if you promise to let me make 100 such bets.” Unless you are a decision theorist, you probably share the intuition of Samuelson’s friend, that playing a very favorable but risky gamble multiple times reduces  the subjective risk. Samuelson found his friend’s answer interesting and went on to analyze it. He proved that under some very specific conditions, a utility maximizer who rejects a single gamble should also reject the offer of many. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 伟大的保罗-萨缪尔森（Paul Samuelson）是二十世纪经济学家中的巨人，他曾问过一个朋友，他是否会  ，接受抛掷硬币的赌博，他可能会损失100美元或赢得200美元。他的朋友回答说："我不会赌，因为我对100美元的损失比200美元的收益感受更深。但如果你答应让我打100次这样的赌，我就接受你。"除非你是一个决策理论家，否则你可能和萨缪尔森的朋友一样有这样的直觉，即多次玩一个非常有利但有风险的赌博，可以减少  的主观风险。萨缪尔森发现他朋友的答案很有趣，于是继续分析。他证明，在一些非常具体的条件下，一个拒绝单一赌博的效用最大化者也应该拒绝许多赌博的提议。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Remarkably, Samuelson did not seem to mind the fact that his proof,  which is of course valid, led to a conclusion that violates common sense, if not rationality:  the offer of a hundred gambles is so attractive that no sane person would reject it. Matthew Rabin and Richard Thaler pointed out that “the aggregated gamble of one hundred 50–50 lose $100/gain $200 bets has an expected return of $5,000, with only a 1/2,300 chance of losing any money and merely a 1/62,000 chance of losing more than $1,000.” Their point, of course, is that if utility theory can be  consistent with such a foolish preference under any circumstances, then something must be wrong with it as a model of rational choice. Samuelson had not seen Rabin’s proof of the absurd consequences of severe loss aversion for small bets, but he would surely not have been surprised by it. His willingness even to consider the possibility that it could be rational to reject the package testifies to  the powerful hold of the rational model. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 值得注意的是，萨缪尔森似乎并不介意他的证明， ，这当然是有效的，但却导致了一个违反常识，甚至违反理性的结论：  ，一百次赌博的提议是如此有吸引力，以至于没有一个正常人会拒绝它。马修-拉宾和理查德-塞勒指出，"一百个50-50的输100美元/赢200美元的赌局，其预期收益为5000美元，只有1/2,300的机会输掉任何钱，仅有1/62,000的机会输掉超过1000美元。"当然，他们的观点是，如果效用理论在任何情况下都能与这种愚蠢的偏好  ，那么它作为理性选择的模型一定有问题。萨缪尔森没有看到拉宾对小赌注的严重损失厌恶的荒谬后果的证明，但他肯定不会对此感到惊讶。他甚至愿意考虑拒绝这套方案可能是理性的，这证明了  ，理性模型的强大影响力。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> This advice is not impossible to follow. Experienced traders in financial markets live by it every day, shielding  themselves from the pain of losses by  broad framing . As was mentioned earlier, we now know that experimental subjects could be almost cured of their loss aversion (in a particular context) by inducing them to “think like a trader,” just as experienced baseball card traders are not as susceptible to the endowment effect as novices are. Students made risky decisions (to accept or reject gambles  in which they could lose) under different instructions. In the narrow-framing condition, they were told to “make each decision as if it were the only one” and to accept their emotions. The instructions for broad framing of a decision included the phrases “imagine yourself as a trader,” “you do this all the time,” and “treat it as one of many monetary decisions, which will sum together to produce a  ‘portfolio.’” The experimenters assessed the subjects’ emotional response to gains and losses by physiological measures, including changes in the electrical conductance of the skin that are used in lie detection. As expected, broad framing blunted the emotional reaction to losses and increased the willingness to take risks. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 这个建议并不是无法遵循。金融市场上有经验的交易者每天都在遵循它，通过 宽泛的框架 将  ，使自己免受损失的痛苦。如前所述，我们现在知道，通过诱导实验对象 "像交易员一样思考"，几乎可以治愈他们的损失厌恶（在特定情况下），正如经验丰富的棒球卡交易员不像新手那样容易受到禀赋效应的影响一样。在不同的指示下，学生们做出了危险的决定（接受或拒绝他们可能会输的赌博  ）。在狭义框架条件下，他们被告知要 "把每个决定当作唯一的决定 "并接受他们的情绪。广义决策的指令包括 "把自己想象成一个交易员"、"你一直在做这个"、"把它当作许多货币决策中的一个，这些决策加起来就会产生一个  '投资组合'"等短语。实验者通过生理措施评估受试者对收益和损失的情绪反应，包括用于测谎的皮肤电导率的变化。正如预期的那样，宽泛的框架削弱了对损失的情绪反应，增加了承担风险的意愿。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The combination of loss aversion and narrow framing is a costly curse.  Individual investors can avoid that curse, achieving the emotional benefits of broad framing while also saving time and agony, by reducing the frequency with which they check how well their investments are doing. Closely following daily fluctuations is a losing proposition, because the pain of the frequent small losses exceeds the pleasure of the equally frequent small gains. Once a quarter is enough,  and may be more than enough for individual investors. In addition to improving the emotional quality of life, the deliberate avoidance of exposure to short-term outcomes improves the quality of both decisions and outcomes. The typical short-term reaction to bad news is increased loss aversion. Investors who get aggregated feedback receive such news much less often and are likely to be less  risk averse and to  end up richer. You are also less prone to useless churning of your portfolio if you don’t know how every stock in it is doing every day (or every week or even every month). A commitment not to change one’s position for several periods ( the equivalent of “locking in”  an investment) improves financial performance. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 损失厌恶和狭义框架的结合是一个昂贵的诅咒。  个人投资者可以避免这种诅咒，通过减少检查他们的投资情况的频率，实现广泛框架的情感利益，同时也节省时间和痛苦。密切关注每天的波动是一个失败的提议，因为频繁的小损失带来的痛苦超过了同样频繁的小收益带来的快乐。一个季度一次就够了，  ，对个人投资者来说可能绰绰有余。除了提高生活的情感质量外，刻意避免接触短期结果也能提高决策和结果的质量。对坏消息的典型短期反应是增加损失厌恶。得到汇总反馈的投资者收到这种消息的频率要低得多，而且很可能不那么  厌恶风险，并且 ，最终更富有。如果你不知道你的投资组合中的每只股票每天（或每周甚至每月）的表现如何，你也不容易对你的投资组合进行无用的搅动。承诺在几个时期内不改变自己的头寸 （相当于 "锁定 " 一项投资）可以提高财务业绩。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Decision makers who are prone to narrow framing  construct a preference every time they face a risky choice. They would do better by having a  risk policy  that they routinely apply whenever a relevant problem arises. Familiar examples of risk policies are “always take the highest possible deductible when purchasing insurance” and “never buy extended warranties.” A risk policy is a broad frame. In the insurance examples, you expect the occasional  loss of the entire deductible, or the occasional failure of an uninsured product. The relevant issue is your ability to reduce or eliminate the pain of the occasional loss by the thought that the policy that left you exposed to it will almost certainly be financially advantageous over the long run. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The outside view and the risk policy are remedies against two distinct biases that affect  many decisions: the exaggerated optimism of the planning fallacy and the exaggerated caution induced by loss aversion. The two biases oppose each other. Exaggerated optimism protects individuals and organizations from the paralyzing effects of loss aversion; loss aversion protects them from the follies of overconfident optimism. The upshot is rather comfortable for the decision maker. Optimists  believe that the decisions they make are more prudent than they really are, and loss-averse decision makers correctly reject marginal propositions that they might otherwise accept. There is no guarantee, of course, that the biases cancel out in every situation. An organization that could eliminate both excessive optimism and excessive loss aversion should do so. The combination of the outside view  with a risk policy should be the goal. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 外部观点和风险政策是针对影响  许多决策的两种不同偏见的补救措施：计划谬误的夸大乐观和损失厌恶所引起的夸大谨慎。这两种偏见是相互对立的。夸张的乐观主义保护个人和组织免受损失规避的麻痹影响；损失规避则保护他们免受过度自信的乐观主义的愚弄。其结果是对决策者来说相当舒适。乐观主义者  ，相信他们所做的决定比实际情况更谨慎，而损失规避的决策者正确地拒绝了他们可能接受的边际主张。当然，不能保证这些偏见在每一种情况下都能被抵消。一个组织如果能够同时消除过度乐观和过度损失规避，就应该这样做。将外部观点  ，与风险政策相结合，应该是目标。 </p></div>

He asked them to consider a risky option in which, with equal probabilities, they could lose a large amount of the capital they controlled or earn double that amount. None of the executives was willing to take such a dangerous gamble.  Thaler then turned to the CEO of the company, who was also present, and asked for his opinion. Without hesitation, the CEO answered, “I would like all of them to accept their risks.” In the context of that conversation, it was natural for the CEO to adopt a broad frame that encompassed all 25 bets.

<p class ="en"> Richard Thaler has been fascinated for many years by analogies between the world of accounting and the mental accounts that we use to organize and run our lives, with results that are sometimes foolish and sometimes very helpful. Mental accounts come in several varieties. We hold our money in different accounts,  which are sometimes physical, sometimes only mental.  We have spending money, general savings, earmarked savings for our children’s education or for medical emergencies. There is a clear hierarchy in our willingness to draw on these accounts to cover current needs. We use accounts for self-control purposes, as in making a household budget, limiting the daily consumption of espressos, or increasing  the time spent exercising. Often we pay for self-control, for instance simultaneously putting money in a savings account and maintaining debt on credit cards. The Econs of the rational-agent model do not resort to mental accounting: they have a comprehensive view of outcomes and are driven by external incentives. For Humans, mental accounts are a form of narrow framing; they keep things under  control and manageable by a finite mind. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 理查德-塞勒（Richard Thaler）多年来一直对会计世界和我们用来组织和管理生活的心理账户之间的类比感到着迷，其结果有时是愚蠢的，有时是非常有用的。心理账户有几个种类。我们在不同的账户中持有我们的钱，  ，这些账户有时是物理的，有时只是心理的。 我们有花钱的地方，有一般的储蓄，有为孩子的教育或医疗紧急情况的专用储蓄。在我们愿意动用这些账户来满足当前需求方面，有一个明显的等级制度。我们将账户用于自我控制的目的，如制定家庭预算，限制每天的浓咖啡消费，或增加  锻炼的时间。我们经常为自我控制付出代价，例如，同时把钱存入储蓄账户和维持信用卡的债务。理性代理模型中的生态人不会诉诸于心理核算：他们对结果有一个全面的看法，并受到外部激励的驱动。对人类来说，心理账户是一种狭隘的框架；它们使事情处于  ，并由一个有限的头脑管理。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Mental accounts are used extensively to keep score. Recall that professional golfers putt more successfully when working to avoid a bogey than to achieve a birdie. One conclusion we can draw is that the best golfers create a separate account for each hole; they do not only maintain a single account for their overall success. An ironic example that Thaler  related in an early article remains one of the best illustrations of how mental accounting affects behavior: </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 心理账户被广泛地用于记分。回顾一下，职业高尔夫球员在努力避免柏忌的时候，比在实现小鸟的时候推杆更成功。我们可以得出的一个结论是，最好的高尔夫球手为每个洞都建立了一个单独的账户；他们不仅为他们的整体成功保持一个单一的账户。Thaler在早期的一篇文章中提到的一个具有讽刺意味的例子  ，至今仍是心理账户如何影响行为的最佳说明之一。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Two avid sports fans plan to travel 40 miles to see a basketball game. One of them paid for his ticket; the other was on his way to purchase a ticket when he got one free from a friend. A blizzard is announced for the night of the game. Which of the two ticket holders is more likely to  brave the blizzard to see the game? </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 两个狂热的体育迷计划旅行40英里去看一场篮球赛。其中一个人付了票钱；另一个人在去买票的路上，从朋友那里得到了一张免费的票。比赛当晚宣布会有暴风雪。这两个持票人中，哪一个更可能  ，冒着暴风雪去看比赛？ </p></div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> The answer is immediate: we know that the fan who paid for his ticket is more likely to drive. Mental accounting provides the explanation. We assume that both fans set up an account for the game they hoped to see. Missing the game will close the accounts with a negative balance. Regardless of how they came by their ticket, both will be disappointed—but the  closing balance is distinctly more negative for the one who bought a ticket and is now out of pocket as well as deprived of the game. Because staying home is worse for this individual, he is more motivated to see the game and therefore more likely to make the attempt to  drive into a blizzard . These are tacit calculations of emotional balance, of the kind that System 1 performs without deliberation.  The emotions that people attach to the state of their mental accounts are not acknowledged in standard economic theory. An Econ would realize that the ticket has already been paid for and cannot be returned. Its cost is “sunk” and the Econ would not care whether he had  bought the ticket to the game or got it from a friend (if Econs have friends). To implement this rational behavior, System 2 would  have to be aware of the counterfactual possibility: “Would I still drive into this snowstorm if I had gotten the ticket free from a friend?” It takes an active and disciplined mind to raise such a difficult question. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 答案是直接的：我们知道付钱买票的球迷更有可能开车。心理核算提供了解释。我们假设两个球迷都为他们希望看到的比赛设立了一个账户。错过比赛将使账户出现负数。无论他们是如何买到票的，都会感到失望--但对于买了票的人来说，  ，结账时的余额显然是更多的负数，因为他现在既没有钱，也被剥夺了看比赛的机会。因为呆在家里对这个人来说更糟，他更有动力去看比赛，因此更有可能尝试 开车进入暴风雪 。这些都是情感平衡的默契计算，是系统1未经深思熟虑就进行的那种计算。  在标准的经济理论中，人们对其心理账户的状态所附加的情感并没有得到承认。一个经济学家会意识到，机票已经被支付了，而且不能被退回。它的成本是 "沉没的"，而且经济学人不会关心他是 ，还是从朋友那里得到的比赛门票（如果经济学人有朋友的话）。为了实现这种理性行为，系统2将  ，必须意识到反事实的可能性。"如果我从朋友那里免费得到了门票，我还会开车进入这场暴风雪吗？"要提出这样一个困难的问题，需要一个积极和有纪律的头脑。 </p></div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> The disposition effect is an instance of  narrow framing . The investor has set up an account for each share that  she bought, and she wants to close every account as a gain. A rational agent would have a comprehensive view of the portfolio and sell the stock that is least likely to do well in the future, without considering whether it is a winner or a loser. Amos told me of a conversation with a financial adviser, who asked him for a complete list of the stocks in his portfolio, including the price at which  each had been purchased. When Amos asked mildly, “Isn’t it supposed not to matter?” the adviser looked astonished. He had apparently always believed that the state of the mental account was a valid consideration. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 处置效应是 狭义框架 的一个实例。投资者为她买入的每只股票设立了一个账户，  ，她想把每个账户都作为收益关闭。一个理性的代理人会对投资组合有一个全面的看法，并卖掉未来最不可能做得好的股票，而不考虑它是赢家还是输家。阿莫斯告诉我与一位财务顾问的谈话，这位财务顾问要求他提供其投资组合中股票的完整清单，包括每个股票的购买价格  。当阿莫斯温和地问道："这不是应该不重要吗？"这位顾问显得很惊讶。他显然一直认为，心理账户的状况是一个有效的考虑因素。 </p></div>

<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Amos’s guess about the financial adviser’s beliefs was probably right, but he was wrong to dismiss the buying price as irrelevant. The purchase price does matter and should be considered,  even by Econs. The disposition effect  is a costly bias because the question of whether to sell winners or losers has a clear answer, and it is not that it makes no difference. If you care about your wealth rather than your immediate emotions, you will sell the loser Tiffany Motors and hang on to the winning Blueberry Tiles. At least in the United States, taxes provide a strong incentive: realizing  losses reduces your taxes, while selling winners exposes you to taxes. This elementary fact of financial life is actually known to all American investors, and it determines the decisions they make during one month of the year—investors sell more losers in December, when taxes are on their mind. The tax advantage is available all year, of course, but for 11 months of the year mental accounting  prevails over financial common sense. Another argument against selling winners is the well-documented market anomaly that stocks that recently gained in value are likely to go on gaining at least for a short while. The net effect is large: the expected after-tax extra return of selling Tiffany rather than Blueberry is 3.4% over the next year. Closing a mental account with a gain is a pleasure, but  it is a pleasure you pay for. The mistake is not one that an Econ would ever make, and experienced investors, who are using their System 2, are  less susceptible  to it than are novices. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 阿莫斯对财务顾问的信念的猜测可能是正确的，但他认为购买价格无关紧要是错误的。购买价格确实很重要，应该被考虑，  ，甚至是Econs。处置效应 ，因为卖出赢家还是输家的问题有一个明确的答案，并不是说它没有区别。如果你关心的是你的财富而不是你眼前的情绪，你会卖掉失败者的蒂芙尼汽车，而保留胜利者的蓝莓瓷砖。至少在美国，税收提供了一个强有力的激励：实现  损失可以减少你的税收，而出售赢家则会使你面临税收。这个金融生活的基本事实实际上是所有美国投资者都知道的，它决定了他们在一年中的某一个月所做的决定--投资者在12月卖出更多的失败者，这时他们会考虑到税收问题。当然，税收优势是全年都有的，但在一年中的11个月里，心理会计  ，胜过财务常识。反对卖出赢家的另一个论据是有据可查的市场反常现象，即最近增值的股票至少在短时间内可能会继续增值。净影响很大：卖出蒂芙尼而不是蓝莓的预期税后额外回报在未来一年是3.4%。以收益关闭心理账户是一种乐趣，但  ，这是一种你付出代价的乐趣。这个错误不是一个经济学人会犯的，有经验的投资者，在使用他们的系统2时，比新手 更不容易受其影响 。 </p></div>

Boards of directors are well aware of these conflicts and often replace a CEO who is encumbered by prior decisions and reluctant to cut losses.

The fear of regret is a factor in many of the decisions that people make (“Don’t do this, you will regret it” is a common warning), and the actual experience of regret is familiar. The emotional state has been well described by two Dutch psychologists, who noted that regret is “accompanied by feelings that one should have known better, by  a sinking feeling , by thoughts about the mistake one has  made and the opportunities lost, by a tendency to kick oneself and to correct one’s mistake, and by wanting to undo the event and to get a second chance.” Intense regret is what you experience when you can most easily imagine yourself doing something other than what you did. </p></div>

After every  plane crash there are special stories about passengers who “should not” have been on the plane—they got a seat at the last moment, they were transferred from another airline,  they were supposed to fly a day earlier but had had to postpone. The common feature of these poignant stories is that they involve unusual events—and unusual events are easier than normal events to undo in imagination. Associative  memory contains a representation of the normal world and its rules. An abnormal event attracts attention, and it also activates the idea of the event that would have been normal under the same circumstances. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> This is curious, because the situations of the two investors are objectively identical. They both now own  stock A and both would have been better off by the same amount if they owned stock B. The only difference is that George got to where he is by acting, whereas Paul got to the same place by failing to act. This short example illustrates a broad story: people expect to have stronger emotional reactions (including regret) to an outcome that is produced by action than to the same outcome when it is  produced by inaction. This has been verified in the context of gambling: people expect to be happier if they gamble and win than if they refrain from gambling and get the same amount. The asymmetry is at least as strong for losses, and it  applies to blame  as well as to regret. The key is not the difference between commission and omission but the distinction between default options and  actions that deviate from the default . When you deviate from the default, you can easily imagine the norm—and if the default is associated with bad consequences, the discrepancy between the two can be the source of painful emotions. The default option when you own a stock is not to sell it, but the default option when you meet your colleague in the morning is to greet him. Selling a stock and failing to greet  your coworker are both departures from the default option and natural candidates for regret or blame. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 这很奇怪，因为这两个投资者的情况客观上是相同的。他们现在都拥有  股票A，如果他们拥有股票B，他们的情况都会好很多。唯一的区别是，乔治是通过行动达到他的目的，而保罗是通过不行动达到同一目的。这个简短的例子说明了一个广泛的故事：人们期望对一个由行动产生的结果产生更强烈的情感反应（包括后悔），而不是对同样的结果由不行动产生的  。这一点在赌博的背景下得到了验证：人们期望如果他们赌博并赢了，会比他们不赌博并得到相同的金额更高兴。这种不对称性对于损失来说至少是同样强烈的，而且它也 适用于责备 和后悔。关键不在于委托和不委托之间的区别，而在于默认选项和 偏离默认的行动 之间的区别  。当你偏离默认值时，你很容易想象到规范--如果默认值与不良后果有关，两者之间的差异就会成为痛苦情绪的来源。当你拥有一支股票时，默认选项是不卖掉它，但当你早上见到你的同事时，默认选项是向他打招呼。卖出股票和没有向你的同事打招呼  ，都是偏离了默认选项，自然会引起后悔或指责。 </p></div>

<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> In a compelling demonstration of the power of default options, participants played a computer simulation of blackjack. Some players were asked “Do you wish to hit?” while others were asked “Do you wish to stand?” Regardless of the question, saying yes was associated with much more regret than  saying no if the outcome was bad! The question evidently suggests a default response, which is, “I don’t have a strong wish to do it.” It is the departure from the default that produces regret. Another situation in which action is the default is that of a coach whose team lost badly in their last game. The coach is expected to make a change of personnel or strategy, and a failure to do so will  produce blame and regret . </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在一个关于默认选项的力量的引人注目的演示中，参与者玩了一个21点的计算机模拟。一些玩家被问到 "你想打吗？"而另一些人则被问到 "你想站着吗？"无论问题是什么，如果结果不好，说 "是 "比  说 "不 "要后悔得多！这个问题显然暗示了一个默认的回答，那就是："我没有强烈的愿望去做这件事。"正是对默认的偏离产生了遗憾。另一种以行动为默认的情况是，一个教练的球队在上一场比赛中输得很惨。教练被期望做出人员或策略的改变，如果不这样做，就会 产生责备和遗憾  。 </p></div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> The  asymmetry in the risk of regret favors conventional and risk-averse choices. The bias appears in many contexts. Consumers who are reminded that they may feel regret as a result of their choices show an increased preference for conventional options, favoring  brand names over generics . The behavior of the managers of financial funds as the year approaches its end also shows an effect of anticipated  evaluation: they tend to  clean up their portfolios  of unconventional and otherwise questionable stocks. Even life-or-death decisions can be affected. Imagine a physician with a gravely ill patient. One treatment fits the normal standard of care; another is unusual. The physician has some reason to believe that the unconventional treatment improves the patient’s chances, but the evidence is inconclusive.  The physician who prescribes the unusual treatment faces a substantial risk of regret, blame, and perhaps litigation. In hindsight, it will be easier to imagine the normal choice; the abnormal choice will be easy to undo. True, a good outcome will contribute to the reputation of the physician who dared, but the potential benefit is smaller than the potential cost because success is generally  a more normal outcome than is failure. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 遗憾风险的不对称性有利于传统和风险规避的选择。这种偏见出现在许多情况下。消费者如果被提醒他们可能会因为自己的选择而感到后悔，就会表现出对传统选择的更多偏好，偏爱 品牌而不是非专利产品 。金融基金经理在接近年底时的行为也显示了预期  评估的影响：他们倾向于 清理其投资组合 中的非常规和其他有问题的股票。甚至生死攸关的决定也会受到影响。想象一下，一个医生面对一个重病患者。一种治疗方法符合正常的护理标准；另一种则是不寻常的。医生有理由相信，非常规的治疗方法可以改善病人的机会，但证据并不确定。  开出非常规治疗方法的医生面临着后悔、指责，甚至是诉讼的巨大风险。事后看来，想象正常的选择会比较容易；不正常的选择则很容易被撤销。诚然，一个好的结果将有助于提高敢于冒险的医生的声誉，但潜在的利益小于潜在的成本，因为成功通常是  ，比失败更正常的结果。 </p></div>

The respondents were told to imagine that they used an insecticide where the risk of inhalation and child poisoning was 15 per 10,000 bottles. A less expensive insecticide was available, for which the risk rose from 15 to 16 per 10,000 bottles.  The parents were asked for the discount that would induce them to switch to the less expensive (and less safe) product. More than two-thirds of the parents in the survey responded that they would not purchase the new product at any price! They were evidently revolted by the very idea of trading the safety of their child for money. The minority who found a discount they could accept demanded an  amount that was significantly higher than the amount they were willing to pay for a far larger improvement in the safety of the product. </p></div>

It is worth noting, however, that this attitude is incoherent and potentially damaging to the safety of those we wish to protect.  Even the most loving parents have finite resources of time and money to protect their child (the keeping-my-child-safe mental account has a limited budget), and it seems reasonable to deploy these resources in a way that puts them to best use. Money that could be saved by accepting a minute increase in the risk of harm from a pesticide could certainly be put to better use in reducing the child’s  exposure  to other harms, perhaps by purchasing a safer car seat or covers for electric sockets. The  taboo tradeoff  against accepting any increase in risk is not an efficient way to use the safety budget. In fact, the resistance may be motivated by a selfish fear of regret more than by a wish to optimize the child’s safety.

<p class ="en"> The intense aversion to trading increased risk for some other advantage plays out on a grand scale in the laws and regulations governing risk. This trend is especially strong in Europe,  where the precautionary principle , which prohibits any action that might cause harm, is a widely accepted  doctrine. In the regulatory context, the precautionary principle imposes the entire burden of proving safety on anyone who undertakes actions that might harm people or the environment. Multiple international bodies have specified that the absence of scientific evidence of potential damage is not sufficient justification for taking risks. As the jurist Cass Sunstein points out, the precautionary  principle is costly, and when interpreted strictly it can be paralyzing. He mentions an impressive list of innovations that would not have passed the test, including “airplanes, air conditioning, antibiotics, automobiles, chlorine, the measles vaccine, open-heart surgery, radio, refrigeration, smallpox vaccine, and X-rays.” The strong version of the precautionary principle is obviously untenable.  But  enhanced loss aversion  is embedded in a strong and widely shared moral intuition; it originates in System 1. The dilemma between intensely loss-averse moral attitudes and efficient risk management does not have a simple and compelling solution. </p></div>

They found, as you surely guessed, that the victim was awarded a much larger sum if he was shot in a store he rarely  visited than if he was shot in his regular store. Poignancy (a close cousin of regret) is a counterfactual feeling, which is evoked because the thought “if only he had shopped at his regular store …” comes readily to mind. The familiar System 1 mechanisms of substitution and intensity matching translate the strength of the emotional reaction to the story onto a monetary scale, creating a large difference  in dollar awards. </p></div>

Almost everyone who sees both scenarios together (within-subject) endorses the principle that poignancy is not a legitimate consideration. Unfortunately, the principle becomes relevant only when the two scenarios are seen together, and this is not how life usually works. We normally experience life in the between-subjects  mode, in which contrasting alternatives that might change your mind are absent, and of course WYSIATI. As a consequence, the beliefs that you endorse when you reflect about morality do not necessarily govern your emotional reactions, and the moral intuitions that come to your mind in different situations are not internally consistent. </p></div>

Remember that you are not negotiating with anyone—your task is to determine the lowest price at which you would truly be willing to give up the bet. Try it. You may find that the prize that can be won is salient in this task, and that your evaluation of what the bet is worth is anchored on that value. The results support this conjecture, and the selling price is higher for  bet A than for bet B. This is a preference reversal: people choose B over A, but if they imagine owning only one of them, they set a higher value on A than on B. As in the burglary scenarios, the preference reversal occurs because joint evaluation focuses attention on an aspect of the situation—the fact that bet A is much less safe than bet B—which was less salient in single evaluation. The features  that caused the difference between the judgments of the options in single evaluation—the poignancy of the victim being in the wrong grocery store and the anchoring on the prize—are suppressed or irrelevant when the options are evaluated jointly. The emotional reactions of System 1 are much more likely to determine single evaluation; the comparison that occurs in joint evaluation always involves  a more careful and effortful assessment, which calls for System 2. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Rational Econs would surely not be susceptible to preference reversals, and the phenomenon  was therefore a challenge to the rational-agent model  and to the economic theory that is built on this model. The challenge could have been ignored, but it was not. A few years after the preference reversals were reported, two respected economists, David Grether and Charles Plott, published an article in  the prestigious  American Economic Review , in which they reported their own studies of the  phenomenon that Lichtenstein and Slovic had described. This was probably the first finding by experimental psychologists that ever attracted the attention of economists. The introductory paragraph of Grether and Plott’s article was unusually dramatic for a scholarly paper, and their intent was clear: “A body of data and theory has been developing within psychology which should be of interest to economists.  Taken at face value the data are simply inconsistent with preference theory and have broad implications about research priorities within economics …. This paper reports the results of a series of experiments designed to discredit the psychologists’ works as applied to economics.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Grether and Plott listed thirteen theories that could explain the original findings and reported carefully designed  experiments that tested these theories. One of their hypotheses, which—needless to say—psychologists found patronizing, was that the results were due to the experiment being carried out by psychologists! Eventually, only one hypothesis was left standing: the psychologists were right. Grether and Plott acknowledged that this hypothesis is the least satisfactory from the point of view of standard  preference theory, because “it allows individual choice to depend on the  context in which the choices are made ”—a clear violation of the coherence doctrine. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> You might think that this surprising outcome would cause much anguished soul-searching among economists, as a basic assumption of their theory had been successfully challenged. But this is not the way things work in social science, including  both psychology and economics. Theoretical beliefs are robust, and it takes much more than  one embarrassing finding  for established theories to be seriously questioned. In fact, Grether and Plott’s admirably forthright report had little direct effect on the convictions of economists, probably including Grether and Plott. It contributed, however, to a greater willingness of the community of economists  to take psychological research seriously and thereby greatly advanced the conversation across the boundaries of the disciplines. </p></div>

Joint evaluation highlights a feature that was not noticeable in single evaluation but is recognized as decisive when detected: farmers are human, dolphins are not. You knew that, of course, but it was not relevant to the judgment that you made in single evaluation. The fact that dolphins are not human did not arise because all the issues that were activated in your memory shared  that feature. The fact that farmworkers are human did not come to mind because all public-health issues involve humans. The narrow framing of single evaluation allowed dolphins to have a higher intensity score, leading to a high rate of contributions by intensity matching. Joint evaluation changes the representation of the issues: the “human vs. animal” feature becomes salient only when the two are  seen together. In joint evaluation people show a solid preference for the farmworkers and a willingness to contribute substantially more to their welfare than to the protection of a likable nonhuman species.

The jurors who  saw the case of the burned child on its own made an offer that matched the intensity of their feelings. They could not anticipate that the award to the child would appear inadequate in the context of  a large award to a financial institution. In joint evaluation, the punitive award to the bank remained anchored on the loss it had sustained, but the award to the burned child increased, reflecting the outrage evoked by negligence that causes injury to a child. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> As we have seen, rationality is generally served by broader and more comprehensive frames, and joint evaluation is obviously broader  than single evaluation. Of course, you should be wary of joint evaluation when someone who controls what you see has a vested interest in what you choose. Salespeople quickly learn that manipulation of the context in which customers see a good can profoundly influence preferences. Except for such cases of deliberate manipulation, there is a presumption that the comparative judgment, which necessarily  involves System 2, is more likely to be stable than single evaluations, which often reflect the intensity of emotional responses of System 1. We would expect that any institution that wishes to elicit thoughtful judgments would seek to provide the judges with a broad context for the assessments of individual cases. I was surprised to learn from Cass Sunstein that jurors who are to assess punitive  damages are explicitly prohibited from considering other cases. The legal system, contrary to psychological common sense, favors single evaluation. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In another study of incoherence in the legal system, Sunstein compared the administrative punishments that can be imposed by different U.S. government agencies including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection  Agency. He concluded that “within categories, penalties seem extremely sensible, at least in the sense that the more serious harms are punished more severely. For occupational safety and health violations, the largest penalties are for repeated violations, the next largest for violations that are both willful and serious, and the least serious for failures to engage in the  requisite record-keeping .” It should not surprise you, however, that the size of penalties varied greatly across agencies, in a manner that reflected politics and history more than any global concern for fairness. The fine for a “serious violation” of the regulations concerning worker safety is capped at $7,000, while a violation of the Wild Bird Conservation Act can result in a fine of up to $25,000. The fines are sensible  in the context of other penalties set by each agency, but they appear odd when compared to each other. As in the other examples in this chapter, you can see the absurdity only when the two cases are viewed together in  a broad frame.

Neuroscientists have run thousands of such experiments, and they have learned to expect particular regions of the brain to “light up”—indicating increased flow of oxygen, which suggests heightened neural activity—depending on the nature of the task. Different regions are active when  the individual attends to a visual object, imagines kicking a ball, recognizes a face, or thinks of a house. Other regions light up when the individual is emotionally aroused, is in conflict, or concentrates on solving a problem. Although neuroscientists carefully avoid the language of “this part of the brain does such and such …,” they have learned a great deal about the “personalities” of different  brain regions, and the contribution of analyses of brain activity to psychological interpretation has greatly improved. The framing study yielded three main findings: </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The KEEP–LOSE study and the survival–mortality experiment differed in one important respect. The participants in the brain-imaging study had many trials in which they encountered the different frames. They had an opportunity  to recognize the distracting effects of the frames and to simplify their task by adopting a common frame, perhaps by translating the LOSE amount into its KEEP equivalent. It would take an intelligent person (and an alert System 2) to learn to do this, and the few participants who managed the feat were probably among the “rational” agents that the experimenters identified. In contrast, the physicians  who read the statistics about the two therapies in the survival frame had no reason to suspect that they would have made a different choice if they had heard the same statistics framed in terms of mortality. Reframing is effortful and System 2 is normally lazy. Unless there is an obvious reason to do otherwise, most of us passively accept decision problems as they are framed and therefore rarely  have an opportunity to discover the extent to which our preferences are  frame-bound  rather than  reality-bound . </p></div>

Decision makers tend to prefer the sure thing over the gamble (they are risk averse) when  the outcomes are good. They tend to reject the sure thing and accept the gamble (they are risk seeking) when both outcomes are negative. These conclusions were well established for choices about gambles and sure things in the domain of money. The disease problem shows that the same rule applies when the outcomes are measured in lives saved or lost. In this context, as well, the framing experiment  reveals that risk-averse and risk-seeking preferences are not reality-bound. Preferences between the same objective outcomes reverse with different formulations. </p></div>

Amos was invited to give a speech to a group of public-health professionals—the people who make decisions about vaccines and other programs. He took the opportunity  to present them with the Asian disease problem: half saw the “lives-saved” version, the others answered the “lives-lost” question. Like other people, these professionals were susceptible to the framing effects.

Schelling’s book was written before our work on framing was published, and framing was not his main concern. He reported on his experience teaching a class at the Kennedy School at Harvard, in which the topic was child exemptions in the tax code. Schelling told his students that a standard exemption is allowed for each child, and that the  amount of the exemption is independent of the taxpayer’s income. He asked their opinion of the following proposition: </p></div>

The difference between the tax due by a childless  family and by a family with two children is described as a reduction of tax in the first version and as an increase in the second. If in the first version you want the poor to receive the same (or greater) benefit as the rich for having children, then you must want the poor to pay at least the same penalty as the rich for being childless. </p></div>

You have moral intuitions about differences between the rich and the poor, but these intuitions depend on an arbitrary reference point, and they are not about the real problem. This problem—the question  about actual states of the world—is how much tax individual families should pay, how to fill the cells in the matrix of the tax code. You have no compelling moral intuitions to guide you in solving that problem. Your moral feelings are attached to frames, to descriptions of reality rather than to reality itself. The message about the nature of framing is stark: framing should not be viewed  as an intervention that masks or distorts an underlying preference. At least in this instance—and also in the problems of the Asian disease and of surgery versus radiation for lung cancer—there is no underlying preference that is masked or distorted by the frame. Our preferences are about framed problems, and our moral intuitions are about descriptions, not about substance. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The explanation should already be familiar—this problem involves mental accounting and the sunk-cost fallacy. The different frames evoke different mental accounts, and the significance of the loss depends on the account to which it is posted. When tickets  to a particular show are lost, it is natural to post them to the account associated with that play. The cost appears to have doubled and may now be more than the experience is worth. In contrast, a loss of cash is charged to a “general revenue” account—the theater patron is slightly poorer than she had thought she was, and the question she is likely to ask herself is whether the small reduction  in her disposable wealth will change her decision about paying for tickets. Most respondents thought it would not. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 这个解释应该已经很熟悉了--这个问题涉及心理会计和沉没成本谬误。不同的框架唤起了不同的心理账户，而损失的意义则取决于它被记入的账户。当  某场演出的门票丢失时，很自然地将其记入与该剧有关的账户。成本似乎增加了一倍，现在可能超过了体验的价值。与此相反，现金的损失被记入 "一般收入 "账户--剧院的顾客比她想象的要稍微贫穷一些，她可能会问自己的问题是，可支配财富的小幅减少  ，是否会改变她支付门票的决定。大多数受访者认为这不会。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> The version in which cash was lost leads to more reasonable decisions. It is a better frame because the loss, even if tickets were lost, is “sunk,” and sunk costs should be ignored. History is irrelevant and the only issue that matters is the set of options the theater patron has  now, and their likely consequences. Whatever she lost, the relevant fact is that she is less wealthy than she was before she opened her wallet. If the person who lost tickets were to ask for my advice, this is what I would say: “Would you have bought tickets if you had lost the equivalent amount of cash? If yes, go ahead and  buy new ones.” Broader frames and inclusive accounts generally lead to  more rational decisions. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 丢失现金的版本会导致更合理的决定。这是一个更好的框架，因为损失，即使是门票损失，也是 "沉没 "的，而沉没成本应该被忽略。历史是不相关的，唯一重要的问题是剧院顾客现在拥有的一系列选择  ，以及它们可能的后果。无论她失去了什么，相关的事实是，她的财富比她打开钱包之前要少。如果那个丢了票的人要征求我的意见，我会这样说。"如果你丢了同等数量的现金，你还会买票吗？如果会，就去 ，买新的吧。"更广泛的框架和包容性的说法通常会导致  更理性的决定。 </p></div>

Most car buyers list gas mileage as one of the factors that determine their choice; they know that high-mileage cars have lower operating costs.

If the two car owners both drive 10,000 miles, Adam will reduce his consumption from a scandalous 833 gallons to a still shocking 714 gallons, for a saving of 119 gallons. Beth’s use of fuel will drop from 333 gallons to 250, saving only 83 gallons. The mpg frame is wrong, and it should  be replaced by the gallons-per-mile frame (or liters-per–100 kilometers, which is used in most other countries).

Jeremy Bentham opened his  Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation  with the famous sentence “Nature has placed mankind under the governance  of two sovereign masters,  pain  and  pleasure . It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall do.” In an awkward footnote, Bentham apologized for applying the word  utility  to these experiences, saying that he had been unable to find a better word. To distinguish Bentham’s interpretation of the term, I will call it  experienced utility . </p></div>

<p class ="en"> For the last 100  years, economists have used the same word to mean something else. As economists and decision theorists apply the term, it means  “wantability” —and I have called it  decision utility . Expected utility theory, for example, is entirely about the rules of rationality that should govern decision utilities; it has nothing at all to say about hedonic experiences. Of course, the two concepts of utility  will coincide if people want what they will enjoy, and enjoy what they chose for themselves—and this assumption of coincidence is implicit in the general idea that economic agents are rational. Rational agents are expected to know their tastes, both present and future, and they are supposed to make good decisions that will maximize these interests. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> My fascination with the  possible discrepancies between experienced utility and decision utility goes back a long way. While Amos and I were still working on prospect theory, I formulated a puzzle, which went like this: imagine an individual who receives one painful injection every day. There is no adaptation; the pain is the same day to day. Will people attach the same value to reducing the number of planned injections from  20 to 18 as from 6 to 4? Is there any justification for a distinction? </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 我对  经验效用和决策效用之间可能存在的差异的迷恋可以追溯到很早以前。当阿莫斯和我还在研究前景理论时，我提出了一个难题，它是这样的：想象一个人每天接受一次痛苦的注射。没有任何适应；疼痛每天都是一样的。人们会不会对把计划中的注射次数从  20次减少到18次与从6次减少到4次赋予同样的价值？有什么理由进行区分吗？ </p></div>

<div class ="bottom">

<p class ="en"> I did not collect data, because the outcome was evident. You can verify for yourself that you would pay more to reduce the number of injections by a third (from 6 to 4) than by one tenth (from 20 to 18). The decision utility of avoiding two injections is higher in the first case than in the second, and everyone will pay more  for the first reduction than for the second. But this difference is absurd. If the pain does not change from day to day, what could justify assigning different utilities to a reduction of the total amount of pain by two injections, depending on the number of previous injections? In the terms we would use today, the puzzle introduced the idea that experienced utility could be measured by the number  of injections. It also suggested that, at least in some cases, experienced utility is the criterion by which a decision should be assessed. A decision maker who pays different amounts to achieve the same gain of experienced utility (or be spared the same loss) is making a mistake. You may find this observation obvious, but in decision theory the only basis for judging that a decision is wrong  is inconsistency with other preferences. Amos and I discussed the problem but we did not pursue it. Many years later, I returned to it. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 我没有收集数据，因为结果是显而易见的。你可以自己验证，减少三分之一的注射次数（从6次到4次）比减少十分之一的注射次数（从20次到18次）付出更多。在第一种情况下，避免两次注射的决策效用高于第二种情况，而且每个人都会为第一次减少支付比第二次更多的  。但这种差异是荒谬的。如果疼痛不会每天都发生变化，那么有什么理由根据以前的注射次数，对减少两次疼痛的总量分配不同的效用呢？用我们今天使用的术语来说，这个谜题提出了这样一个观点：经验的效用可以通过注射的次数来衡量  。它还表明，至少在某些情况下，经验效用是评估一个决定的标准。一个决策者如果为获得相同的经验效用（或避免相同的损失）而支付不同的金额，那就是犯了一个错误。你可能觉得这个观察很明显，但在决策理论中，判断一个决定是错误的唯一依据  ，就是与其他偏好的不一致。阿莫斯和我讨论了这个问题，但我们并没有继续讨论。许多年后，我又回到了这个问题。 </p></div>

How should we answer questions such as “How much pain did Helen suffer during the medical procedure?” or “How much enjoyment did she get from her 20 minutes on the beach?” The British economist Francis  Edgeworth speculated about this topic in the nineteenth century and proposed the idea of a “hedonimeter,” an imaginary instrument analogous to the devices used in weather-recording stations, which would measure the level of pleasure or pain that an individual experiences  at any moment . </p></div>

Redelmeier,  a physician and researcher  at the University of Toronto, carried it out in the early 1990s. This procedure is now routinely administered with an anesthetic as well as an amnesic drug, but these drugs were not as widespread when our data were collected. The patients were prompted every 60 seconds to indicate the level of pain they experienced at the moment. The data shown are on a scale where zero is “no pain at  all” and 10 is “intolerable pain.” As you can see, the experience of each patient varied considerably during the procedure, which lasted 8 minutes for patient A and 24 minutes for patient B (the last reading of zero pain was recorded after the end of the procedure). A total of 154 patients participated in the experiment; the shortest procedure lasted 4 minutes, the longest 69 minutes. </p></div>

Each cold-hand episode is a set of moments, which the remembering self stores as a prototypical moment. This leads to a conflict. For an objective observer evaluating the episode from the reports of the experiencing self, what counts is the “area under the curve” that integrates pain over time; it has the nature of a sum. The memory that the remembering self keeps,  in contrast, is a representative moment, strongly influenced by the peak and the end. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Of course, evolution could have designed animals’ memory to store integrals, as it surely does in some cases. It is important for a squirrel to “know” the total amount of food it has stored, and a representation of the average size of the nuts would not be a good substitute. However, the integral of pain or  pleasure over time may be less biologically significant.  We know, for example, that rats show duration neglect for both pleasure and pain. In one experiment, rats were consistently exposed to a sequence in which the onset of a light signals that an electric shock will soon be delivered. The rats quickly learned to fear the light, and the intensity of their fear could be measured by several physiological  responses. The main finding was that the  duration of the shock  has little or no effect on fear—all that matters is the painful intensity of the stimulus. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The most useful idea in the injections puzzle that preoccupied me years ago was that the experienced utility of a series of equally painful injections can be measured, by simply counting the injections. If all injections are equally aversive, then 20 of them are twice as bad as 10, and a reduction from 20 to 18 and a reduction  from 6 to 4 are equally valuable. If the decision utility does not correspond to the experienced utility, then something is wrong with the decision. The same logic played out in the cold-hand experiment: an episode of pain that lasts 90 seconds is worse than the first 60 seconds of that episode. If people willingly choose to endure the longer episode, something is wrong with their decision. In my  early puzzle, the discrepancy between the decision and the experience originated from diminishing sensitivity: the difference between 18 and 20 is less impressive, and appears to be worth less, than the difference between 6 and 4 injections. In the cold-hand experiment, the error reflects two principles of memory: duration neglect and the peak-end rule. The mechanisms are different but the outcome  is the same: a decision that is not correctly attuned to the experience. </p></div>

The cold-hand study showed that we cannot fully trust  our preferences to reflect our interests, even if they are based on personal experience, and even if the  memory of that experience was laid down within the last quarter of an hour! Tastes and decisions are shaped by memories, and the memories can be wrong. The evidence presents a profound challenge to the idea that humans have consistent preferences and know how to maximize them, a cornerstone of the rational-agent model. An inconsistency is built into the design of our minds. We have strong preferences  about the duration of our experiences of pain and pleasure. We want pain to be brief and pleasure to last. But our memory, a function of System 1, has evolved to represent the most intense moment of an episode of pain or pleasure (the peak) and the feelings when the episode was at its end. A memory that neglects duration will not serve our preference for long pleasure and short pains. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Early in the days of my work on the measurement of experience, I saw Verdi’s opera  La Traviata . Known for its gorgeous music, it is also a moving story of the love between a young aristocrat and Violetta, a woman  of the demimonde. The young man’s father approaches Violetta and convinces her to give up her lover, to protect the honor of the family and the marriage prospects of the young man’s sister. In an act of supreme self-sacrifice, Violetta pretends to reject the man she adores. She soon relapses into consumption (the nineteenth-century term for tuberculosis). In the final act, Violetta lies dying, surrounded  by a few friends. Her beloved has been alerted and is rushing to Paris to see her. Hearing the news, she is transformed with hope and joy, but she is also deteriorating quickly. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 在我从事经验测量工作的早期，我看过威尔第的歌剧 《茶花女 》。这部歌剧以其华丽的音乐而闻名，也是一个动人的故事，讲述了一个年轻的贵族和维奥莱塔之间的爱情，维奥莱塔是一个来自贫民区的女人  。年轻人的父亲找到维奥莱塔，说服她放弃她的情人，以保护家族的荣誉和年轻人妹妹的婚姻前景。在一个最高的自我牺牲的行为中，维奥莱塔假装拒绝了她所爱慕的男人。她很快就患上了肺结核（十九世纪对肺结核的称呼）。在最后一幕中，维奥莱塔奄奄一息，身边只有几个朋友，  。她的爱人已经被惊动，正赶往巴黎看她。听到这个消息，她被希望和喜悦所感染，但她的病情也在迅速恶化。 </p></div>

<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> On my way home from the opera, I wondered: Why do we care so much about those last 10 minutes? I quickly realized that I did not care at all about the length of Violetta’s life. If I had been told that she died at age 27, not age 28 as I believed, the news that she had  missed a year of happy life would not have moved me at all, but the possibility of missing the last 10 minutes mattered a great deal. Furthermore, the emotion I felt about the lovers’ reunion would not have changed if I had learned that they actually had a week together,  rather than 10 minutes. If the lover had come too late, however,  La Traviata  would have been an altogether different story.  A story is about significant events and memorable moments, not about time passing. Duration neglect is normal in a story, and the ending often defines its character. The same core features appear in the rules of narratives and in the memories of colonoscopies, vacations, and films. This is how the remembering self works: it composes stories and keeps them for future reference. </p></div>

We feel pity for a man who died believing in his wife’s love for him, when we hear that she  had a lover  for many years and stayed with her husband only for his money. We pity the husband although he had lived a happy life. We feel the humiliation  of a scientist who made an important discovery that was proved false after she died, although she did not experience the humiliation.

They used a short description of the life of a fictitious character called Jen, a never-married woman with no children, who died instantly and painlessly in an automobile accident. In one version of Jen’s story, she was extremely happy throughout her life (which lasted either 30 or 60 years), enjoying her work, taking vacations, spending time with her friends and on her hobbies.  Another version added 5 extra years to Jen’s life, who now died either when she was 35 or 65. The extra years were described as pleasant but less so than before. After reading a schematic biography of Jen, each participant answered two questions: “Taking her life as a whole, how desirable do you think Jen’s life was?” and “How much total happiness or unhappiness would you say that Jen experienced  in her life?” </p></div>

A continuous record of experience was unfortunately impossible—a person cannot live normally while constantly reporting her experiences. The closest alternative was experience sampling, a method that Csikszentmihalyi had  invented. Technology has advanced since its first uses. Experience sampling is now implemented by programming an individual’s cell phone to beep or vibrate at random intervals during the day. The phone then presents a brief menu of questions about what the respondent was doing and who was with her when she was interrupted. The participant is also shown rating scales to report the  intensity of various feelings : happiness, tension, anger, worry, engagement, physical pain, and others. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Experience sampling is expensive and burdensome (although less disturbing than most people initially expect; answering the questions takes very little time). A more practical alternative was needed, so we developed a method that we called the Day Reconstruction Method (DRM). We hoped it would approximate the results of  experience sampling and provide additional  information about the way people  spend their time . Participants (all women, in the early studies) were invited to a two-hour session. We first asked them to relive the previous day in detail, breaking it up into episodes like scenes in a film. Later, they answered menus of questions about each episode, based on the experience-sampling method. They selected  activities in which they were engaged from a list and indicated the one to which they paid most attention. They also listed the individuals they had been with, and rated the intensity of several feelings on separate 0–6 scales (0 = the absence of the feeling; 6 = most intense feeling). Our method drew on evidence that people who are able to retrieve a past situation in detail are also able to  relive the feelings that accompanied it, even experiencing their earlier  physiological indications of emotion . </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 经验取样是昂贵和繁琐的（尽管比大多数人最初预期的要少一些干扰；回答问题只需要很少的时间）。我们需要一个更实用的替代方法，所以我们开发了一种方法，我们称之为日重建法（DRM）。我们希望它能接近  经验抽样的结果，并提供关于人们 花费时间 的方式的额外 信息。参与者（在早期的研究中，都是女性）被邀请参加一个两小时的会议。我们首先要求他们详细回顾前一天的情况，像电影中的场景一样把它分成若干个情节。随后，他们根据经验抽样法回答了关于每个情节的问题菜单。他们从列表中选择了他们所参与的  活动，并指出他们最关注的活动。他们还列出了与他们在一起的人，并对几种感觉的强度进行了0-6的评分（0=没有这种感觉；6=最强烈的感觉）。我们的方法借鉴了一些证据，即能够详细检索过去情况的人也能够  ，重温伴随它的感觉，甚至体验到他们早期的 生理情感迹象 。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> We assumed that our participants would fairly accurately recover the feeling of a prototypical moment of the episode. Several comparisons with experience sampling confirmed the validity of the DRM. Because the participants also reported the times at which episodes began and ended, we  were able to compute a duration-weighted measure of their feeling during the entire waking day. Longer episodes counted more than short episodes in our summary measure of daily affect. Our questionnaire also included measures of life satisfaction, which we interpreted as the satisfaction of the remembering self. We used the DRM to study the determinants of both emotional well-being and life satisfaction  in several thousand women in the United States, France, and Denmark. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The experience of a moment or an episode is not easily represented by a single happiness value. There are many variants of positive feelings, including love, joy, engagement, hope, amusement, and many others. Negative emotions also come in many varieties, including anger, shame, depression, and loneliness. Although positive  and negative emotions exist at the same time, it is possible to classify most moments of life as ultimately positive or negative. We could identify unpleasant episodes by comparing the ratings of positive and negative adjectives. We called an episode unpleasant if a negative feeling was assigned a higher rating than all the positive feelings. We found that American women spent about 19% of the time  in an unpleasant state, somewhat higher than French women (16%) or Danish women (14%). </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 一个时刻或一个情节的体验不容易用一个单一的幸福值来表示。积极情绪有很多变种，包括爱、快乐、参与、希望、娱乐，以及其他许多变种。负面情绪也有很多种类，包括愤怒、羞耻、抑郁和孤独。尽管积极的  和消极的情绪同时存在，但有可能将生活中的大多数时刻归类为最终的积极或消极。我们可以通过比较积极和消极形容词的评分来确定不愉快的情节。如果一种消极的感觉被赋予比所有积极的感觉更高的评价，我们就称其为不愉快的事件。我们发现，美国妇女花了大约19%的时间  ，处于不愉快的状态，比法国妇女（16%）或丹麦妇女（14%）高一些。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> We called the percentage of time that an individual spends in an unpleasant  state the U-index .

The appeal of the U-index is that it is based not on a rating scale but on an  objective measurement  of time. If the U-index for a population drops from 20% to 18%, you can infer that the total time that the population spent in emotional discomfort or pain has diminished by a tenth. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> A U-index can also be computed for activities. For example, we can measure the  proportion of time that people spend in a negative emotional state while commuting, working, or interacting with their parents, spouses, or children. For 1,000 American women in a Midwestern city, the U-index was 29% for the morning commute, 27% for work, 24% for child care, 18% for housework, 12% for socializing, 12% for TV watching, and 5% for sex. The U-index was higher by about 6% on weekdays  than it was on weekends, mostly because on weekends people spend less time in activities they dislike and do not suffer the tension and stress associated with work. The biggest surprise was the emotional experience of the time spent with one’s children, which for American women was slightly less enjoyable than doing housework. Here we found one of the few contrasts between French and American women:  Frenchwomen spend less time with their children but enjoy it more, perhaps because they have more access to child care and spend less of the afternoon driving children to various activities. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> An individual’s mood at any moment depends on her temperament and overall happiness, but emotional well-being also fluctuates considerably over the day and the week. The mood of the moment depends primarily  on the current situation. Mood at work, for example, is largely unaffected by the factors that influence general job satisfaction, including benefits and status. More important are situational factors such as an opportunity to socialize with coworkers, exposure to loud noise, time pressure (a significant source of negative affect), and the immediate presence of a boss (in our first study, the only  thing that was worse than being alone). Attention is key. Our emotional state is largely determined by what we attend to, and we are normally focused on our current activity and immediate environment. There are exceptions, where the quality of subjective experience is dominated by recurrent thoughts rather than by the events of the moment. When happily  in love, we may feel joy even when caught  in traffic, and if grieving, we may remain depressed when watching a funny movie. In normal circumstances, however, we draw pleasure and pain from what is happening at the moment, if we attend to it. To get pleasure from eating, for example, you must notice that you are doing it. We found that French and American women spent about the same amount of time eating, but for Frenchwomen, eating was twice  as likely to be focal as it was for American women. The Americans were far more prone to combine eating with other activities, and their pleasure from eating was correspondingly diluted. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> These observations have implications for both individuals and society. The use of time is one of the areas of life over which people have some control. Few individuals can will themselves to have a sunnier disposition,  but some may be able to arrange their lives to spend less of their day commuting, and more time doing things they enjoy with people they like. The feelings associated with different activities suggest that another way to improve experience is to switch time from passive leisure, such as TV watching, to more active forms of leisure, including socializing and exercise. From the social perspective,  improved transportation for the labor force, availability of child care for working women, and improved socializing opportunities for the elderly may be relatively efficient ways to reduce the U-index of society—even a reduction by 1% would be a significant achievement, amounting to millions of hours of avoided suffering. Combined national surveys of time use and of experienced well-being  can inform social policy in multiple ways. The economist on our team, Alan Krueger, took the lead in an effort to introduce elements of this method into national statistics. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The satiation level beyond which experienced well-being no longer increases was a household income of about  $75,000 in high-cost areas  (it could be less in areas where the cost of living is lower). The average increase of experienced well-being associated with incomes beyond that level was precisely zero. This is surprising  because higher income undoubtedly permits the purchase of many pleasures, including vacations in interesting places and opera tickets, as well as an improved living environment. Why do these added pleasures not show up in reports of emotional experience? A plausible interpretation is that higher income is associated with a reduced ability to enjoy the small pleasures of life. There is suggestive  evidence in favor of this idea: priming students with the idea of wealth reduces the pleasure their face expresses as they  eat a bar of chocolate! </p></div>

<p class ="en"> There is a clear contrast between the effects of income on experienced well-being and on life satisfaction. Higher income brings with it higher satisfaction, well beyond the point at which it ceases to have any positive effect on experience. The general  conclusion is as clear for well-being as it was for colonoscopies: people’s evaluations of their lives and their actual experience may be related, but they are also different. Life satisfaction is not a flawed measure of their experienced well-being, as I thought some years ago. It is something else entirely. </p></div>

In the useful term introduced by Daniel Gilbert and Timothy Wilson, the decision to get  married reflects, for many people, a massive error of  affective forecasting .

<p class ="en"> The startling news of  figure 16  is the steep decline of life satisfaction. The graph is commonly interpreted  as tracing a process of adaptation, in which the early joys of marriage quickly disappear as the experiences become routine. However, another approach is possible, which focuses on heuristics of judgment. Here we ask what happens in people’s minds when they are asked to evaluate their life. The questions “How satisfied are you with your life as a whole?” and “How happy are you these days?” are not  as simple as “What is your telephone number?” How do survey participants manage to answer such questions in a few seconds, as all do? It will help to think of this as another judgment. As is also the case for other questions, some people may have a ready-made answer, which they had produced on another occasion in which they evaluated their life. Others, probably the majority, do not quickly find  a response to the exact question they were asked, and automatically make their task easier by substituting the answer to another question. System 1 is at work. When we look at  figure 16  in this light, it takes on a different meaning. </p></div>

In another well-known experiment in the same vein, Norbert Schwarz and his colleagues invited subjects to the lab to complete a  questionnaire on life satisfaction . Before they began that task, however, he asked them to photocopy a sheet of paper for him. Half the  respondents found a dime on the copying machine, planted there by the experimenter.

However, if this apparent surge reflects the time course of a heuristic for answering the question, there is little we can learn from it  about either happiness or about the process of adaptation to marriage. We cannot infer from it that a tide of raised happiness lasts for several years and gradually recedes. Even people who are happy to be reminded of their marriage when asked a question about their life are not necessarily happier the rest of the time. Unless they think happy thoughts about their marriage during much of their day,  it will not directly influence their happiness.

They spend more time making love, which is wonderful, but also more time doing housework, preparing food, and caring for children, all relatively unpopular activities. And of course, the large  amount of time married women spend with their husband is much more pleasant for some than for others.

A disposition for well-being is as heritable as height or intelligence, as demonstrated by studies of twins separated at birth. People who appear equally fortunate vary greatly in how happy they are. In some instances, as in the case of marriage, the correlations with well-being  are low because of balancing effects. The same situation may be good for some people and bad for others, and new circumstances have both benefits and costs. In other cases, such as high income, the effects on life satisfaction are generally positive, but the picture is complicated by the fact that some people care much more about money than others do. </p></div>

We compared life satisfaction in a high-income group (more than $200,000 household income) to a low-to moderate-income group (less than $50,000). The effect of income on life satisfaction was  larger for those who had listed being well-off financially  as an essential goal: .57 point on a 5-point scale.

The people who wanted money and got it were significantly more satisfied than average; those who wanted money and didn’t get it were significantly more dissatisfied. The same principle  applies to other goals—one recipe for a dissatisfied adulthood is setting goals that are especially difficult to attain.

You think of other things as you drive, and your mood is determined by whatever you think about. Here again, when you tried to rate how much you enjoyed your car, you actually answered a much narrower question: “How  much pleasure do you get from your car  when you think about it ?” The substitution caused you to ignore the fact that you rarely think about your car, a form of duration neglect. The upshot is a focusing illusion. If you like your car, you are likely to exaggerate the pleasure you derive from it, which will mislead you when you think of the virtues of your current vehicle as well as when you contemplate  buying a new one. </p></div>

When asked about the happiness of Californians, you probably conjure an image of someone attending to a distinctive aspect of the California experience, such as hiking in the summer or admiring the mild winter weather. The focusing illusion arises because Californians actually spend little time attending to  these aspects of their life. Moreover, long-term Californians are unlikely to be reminded of the climate when asked for a global evaluation of their life. If you have been there all your life and do not travel much, living in California is like having ten toes: nice, but not something one thinks much about. Thoughts of any aspect of life are more likely to be salient if a contrasting alternative is  highly available. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> This question almost certainly made you think of a paraplegic who is currently thinking about some aspect of his condition. Your guess about a paraplegic’s  mood is therefore likely to be accurate in the early days after a crippling accident;  for some time after the event, accident victims think of little else. But over time, with few exceptions, attention is withdrawn from a new situation as it becomes more familiar. The main exceptions are chronic pain, constant exposure to loud noise, and severe depression. Pain and noise are biologically set to be signals that attract attention, and depression involves a self-reinforcing cycle of miserable  thoughts. There is therefore no adaptation to these conditions. Paraplegia, however, is not one of the exceptions: detailed observations show that paraplegics are in a fairly good mood more than half of the time as early as one month following their accident—though their mood is certainly somber when they  think about their situation . Most of the time, however, paraplegics work, read, enjoy jokes  and friends, and get angry when they read about politics in the newspaper. When they are involved in any of these activities, they are not much different from anyone else, and we can expect the experienced well-being of paraplegics to be near normal much of the time. Adaptation to a new situation, whether good or bad, consists in large part of thinking less and less about it. In that sense, most  long-term circumstances of life, including paraplegia and marriage, are part-time states that one inhabits only when one attends to them. </p></div>

And one of my favorite experiences in this vein was a project in which Beruria Cohn collected and analyzed data from a survey firm that  asked respondents to estimate the proportion of time that paraplegics spend in a bad mood. She split her respondents into two groups: some were told that the crippling accident had occurred a month earlier, some a year earlier. In addition, each respondent indicated whether he or she knew a paraplegic personally. The two groups agreed closely in their judgment about the recent paraplegics: those  who knew a paraplegic estimated 75% bad mood; those who had to imagine a paraplegic said 70%. In contrast, the two groups differed sharply in their estimates of the mood of paraplegics a year after the accidents: those who knew a paraplegic offered 41% as their estimate of the time in that bad mood. The estimates of those who were not personally acquainted with a paraplegic averaged 68%. Evidently,  those who knew a paraplegic had observed the gradual withdrawal of attention from the condition, but others did not forecast that this adaptation would occur. Judgments about the mood of lottery winners one month and one year after the event showed exactly the same pattern. </p></div>

The value of an episode—I have called it a hedonimeter total—is simply the sum of the values of its moments. But this is not how the mind  represents episodes. The remembering self, as I have described it, also tells stories and makes choices, and neither the stories nor the choices properly represent  time. In storytelling mode, an episode is represented by a few critical moments, especially the beginning, the peak, and the end. Duration is neglected.

The two species were the  fictitious Econs, who live in the land of theory, and the Humans, who act in the real world. The two selves are the experiencing self, which does the living, and the remembering self, which keeps score and makes the choices.

<p class ="en"> The possibility of conflicts between the remembering  self and the interests of the experiencing self turned out to be a harder problem than I initially thought. In an early experiment, the cold-hand study, the combination of duration neglect and the peak-end rule led to choices that were manifestly absurd. Why would people willingly expose themselves to unnecessary pain? Our subjects left the choice to their remembering self, preferring to repeat  the trial that left the better memory, although it involved more pain. Choosing by the quality of the memory may be justified in extreme cases, for example when post-traumatic stress is a possibility, but the cold-hand  experience was not traumatic. An objective observer making the choice for someone else would undoubtedly choose the short exposure, favoring the sufferer’s experiencing self. The  choices that people made on their own behalf are fairly described as mistakes. Duration neglect and the peak-end rule in the evaluation of stories, both at the opera and in judgments of Jen’s life, are equally indefensible. It does not make sense to evaluate an entire life by its last moments, or to give no weight to duration in deciding which life is more desirable. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The remembering self is a  construction of System 2. However, the distinctive features of the way it evaluates episodes and lives are characteristics of our memory. Duration neglect and the peak-end rule originate in System 1 and do not necessarily correspond to the values of System 2. We believe that duration is important, but our memory tells us it is not. The rules that govern the evaluation of the past are poor guides  for decision making, because time does matter. The central fact of our existence is that time is the ultimate finite resource, but the remembering self ignores that reality. The neglect of duration combined with the peak-end rule causes a bias that favors a short period of intense joy over a long period of moderate happiness. The mirror image of the same bias makes us fear a short period of intense  but tolerable suffering more than we fear a much longer period of moderate pain. Duration neglect also makes us prone to accept a long period of mild unpleasantness because the end will be better, and it favors giving up an opportunity for a long happy period if it is likely to have a poor ending. To drive the same idea to the point of discomfort, consider the common admonition, “Don’t do it, you  will regret it.” The advice sounds wise because anticipated regret is the verdict of the remembering self and we are inclined to accept such judgments as final and conclusive. We should not forget, however, that the perspective of the remembering self is not always correct. An objective observer of the hedonimeter profile, with the interests of the experiencing self in mind, might well offer different  advice. The remembering self’s neglect of duration, its exaggerated emphasis on peaks and ends, and its susceptibility to hindsight combine to yield distorted reflections of our actual experience. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In contrast, the duration-weighted conception of well-being treats all moments of life alike, memorable or not. Some moments end up weighted more than others, either because they are memorable or because  they are important. The time that people spend dwelling on a memorable moment should be included in its duration, adding to its weight. A moment can also  gain importance by altering the experience of subsequent moments. For example, an hour spent practicing the violin may enhance the experience of many hours of playing or listening to music years later. Similarly, a brief awful event that causes  PTSD should be weighted by the total duration of the long-term misery it causes. In the duration-weighted perspective, we can determine only after the fact that a moment is memorable or meaningful. The statements “I will always remember …” or “this is a meaningful moment” should be taken as promises or predictions, which can be false—and often are—even when uttered with complete sincerity. It is  a good bet that many of the things we say we will always remember will be long forgotten ten years later. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In everyday speech, we call people reasonable if it is possible to reason with them, if their beliefs are generally in tune with reality, and if their preferences are in line with their interests and their values. The word  rational  conveys an image of greater deliberation, more calculation, and less warmth, but in common  language a rational person is certainly reasonable. For economists and decision theorists, the adjective has an altogether different meaning. The only test of rationality is not whether a person’s beliefs and preferences are reasonable, but whether they are internally consistent. A rational person can believe in ghosts so long as all her other beliefs are consistent with the existence of ghosts.  A rational person can prefer being hated over being loved, so long as his preferences are consistent. Rationality is logical coherence—reasonable or not. Econs are rational by this definition, but there is overwhelming evidence that Humans cannot be. An Econ would not be susceptible to priming, WYSIATI, narrow framing, the inside view, or preference reversals, which Humans cannot consistently avoid. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Although Humans are not irrational, they often need help to make more accurate judgments and better decisions, and in some cases policies and institutions can provide that help. These claims  may seem innocuous, but they are in fact quite controversial. As interpreted by the important Chicago school of economics, faith in human rationality is closely linked to an ideology in which it is unnecessary and even immoral to protect people against their choices. Rational people should be free, and they should be responsible for taking care of themselves. Milton Friedman, the leading figure in  that school, expressed this view in the title of one of his popular books:  Free to Choose . </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The assumption that agents are rational provides the intellectual foundation for the libertarian approach to public policy: do not interfere with the individual’s right to choose, unless the choices harm others. Libertarian  policies are further bolstered by admiration for the efficiency of markets in allocating  goods to the people who are willing to pay the most for them. A famous example of the Chicago approach is titled  A Theory of Rational Addiction ; it explains how a rational agent with a strong preference for intense and immediate gratification may make the rational decision to  accept future addiction  as a consequence. I once heard Gary Becker, one of the authors of that article, who is also a Nobel  laureate of the Chicago school, argue in a lighter vein, but not entirely as a joke, that we should consider the possibility of explaining the so-called obesity epidemic by people’s belief that a cure for diabetes will soon become available. He was making a valuable point: when we observe people acting in ways that seem odd, we should first examine the possibility that they have a good reason  to do what they do. Psychological interpretations should only be invoked when the reasons become implausible—which Becker’s explanation of obesity probably is. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In a nation of Econs, government should keep out of the way, allowing the Econs to act as they choose, so long as they do not harm others. If a motorcycle rider chooses to ride without a helmet, a libertarian will support his right to  do so. Citizens know what they are doing, even when they choose not to save for their old age, or when they expose themselves to addictive substances. There is sometimes a hard edge to this position: elderly people who did not save enough for retirement get little more sympathy than someone who complains about the bill after consuming a large meal at a restaurant. Much is therefore at stake in the  debate between the Chicago school and the behavioral economists, who reject the extreme form of the rational-agent model. Freedom is not a contested value; all the participants in the debate are in favor of it. But life is more complex for behavioral economists than for true believers in human rationality. No behavioral economist favors a state that will force its citizens to eat a balanced diet  and to watch only television programs that are good for the soul. For behavioral economists, however, freedom has a cost, which is borne by individuals who make bad choices, and by a society that feels obligated to help them. The decision of whether or not to protect individuals against their mistakes therefore presents a dilemma for behavioral economists. The economists of the Chicago school do not  face that problem, because rational agents do not make mistakes. For adherents of this school, freedom is free of charge. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In 2008 the economist Richard Thaler and the jurist Cass Sunstein teamed up to write a book,  Nudge , which quickly became an international bestseller and the bible of behavioral economics. Their book introduced several new words into the language, including Econs and Humans.  It also  presented a set of solutions to the dilemma of how to help people make good decisions without curtailing their freedom. Thaler and Sunstein advocate a position of libertarian paternalism, in which the state and other institutions are allowed to  nudge  people to make decisions that serve their own long-term interests. The designation of joining a pension plan as the default option is an  example of a nudge. It is difficult to argue that anyone’s freedom is diminished by being automatically enrolled in the plan, when they merely have to check a box to opt out. As we saw earlier, the framing of the individual’s decision—Thaler and Sunstein call it choice architecture—has a huge effect on the outcome. The nudge is based on sound psychology, which I described earlier. The default option  is naturally perceived as the normal choice. Deviating from the normal choice is an act of commission, which requires more effortful deliberation, takes on more responsibility, and is more likely to evoke regret than doing nothing. These are powerful forces that may guide the decision of someone who is otherwise unsure of what to do. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Humans, more than Econs, also need protection from others who  deliberately exploit their weaknesses—and especially the quirks of System 1 and the laziness of System 2. Rational agents are assumed to make important decisions carefully, and to use all the information that is provided to them. An Econ will read and understand the fine print of a contract before signing it, but Humans usually do not. An unscrupulous firm that designs contracts that customers  will routinely sign without reading has considerable legal leeway in hiding important information in plain sight. A pernicious implication of the rational-agent model in its extreme form is that customers are assumed to need no protection beyond ensuring that the relevant information is disclosed. The size of the print and the complexity of the language in the disclosure are not considered relevant—an  Econ knows how to deal with small print when it matters. In contrast, the recommendations of  Nudge  require firms to offer contracts that are sufficiently simple to be read and understood by Human customers. It is a good sign that some of these recommendations have encountered significant opposition from firms whose profits might suffer if their customers were better informed. A world in which  firms compete by offering better products is preferable to one in which the winner is the firm that is best at obfuscation. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> A remarkable feature of libertarian paternalism is its appeal across a broad political spectrum. The flagship example of behavioral policy, called Save More Tomorrow, was sponsored in Congress by an unusual coalition that included extreme conservatives as well as liberals.  Save More Tomorrow  is a financial plan that firms can offer their employees. Those who sign on allow the employer to increase their contribution to their saving plan by a fixed proportion whenever they receive a raise. The increased saving rate is implemented automatically until the employee gives notice that she wants to opt out of it. This brilliant innovation, proposed by Richard Thaler and  Shlomo Benartzi in 2003, has now improved the savings rate and brightened the future prospects of millions of workers. It is soundly based in the psychological principles that readers of this book will recognize. It avoids the resistance to an immediate loss by requiring no immediate change; by tying increased saving to pay raises, it turns losses into foregone gains, which are much easier to bear;  and the feature of automaticity aligns the laziness of System 2 with the long-term interests of the workers. All this, of course, without compelling anyone to do anything he does not wish to do and without any misdirection or artifice. </p></div>

You may not know that you are optimistic about a project because something about its leader reminds you of your beloved sister,  or that you dislike a person who looks vaguely like your dentist. If asked for an explanation, however, you will search your memory for presentable reasons and will certainly find some. Moreover, you will believe the story you make up.

The investment of attention  improves performance in numerous activities—think of the risks of driving through a narrow space while your mind is wandering—and is essential to some tasks, including comparison, choice, and ordered reasoning. However, System 2 is not a paragon of rationality. Its abilities are limited and so is the knowledge to which it has access.

Except for some effects that I attribute mostly to age,  my intuitive thinking is just as prone to overconfidence, extreme predictions, and the planning fallacy as it was before I made a study of these issues.

This is how you will proceed when you next encounter the Müller-Lyer illusion. When you see lines with fins pointing in different directions, you will recognize the situation as one in which you should  not trust your impressions of length. Unfortunately, this sensible procedure is least likely to be applied when it is needed most. We would all like to have a warning bell that rings loudly whenever we are about to make a serious error, but no such bell is available, and cognitive illusions are generally more difficult to recognize than perceptual illusions. The voice of reason may be much fainter  than the loud and clear voice of an erroneous intuition, and questioning your intuitions is unpleasant when you face the stress of a big decision. More doubt is the last thing you want when you are in trouble. The upshot is that it is much easier to identify a minefield when you observe others wandering into it than when you are about to do so. Observers are less cognitively busy and more open  to information than actors.

Occasionally, beliefs concerning uncertain events are expressed in numerical form as odds or subjective probabilities. What determines such beliefs? How do people assess the probability of an uncertain event or the value of an uncertain quantity?

<p class ="en"> The subjective assessment of probability resembles the subjective assessment of physical quantities such as distance or size. These judgments are all based on data of limited validity, which are processed according to heuristic rules. For  example, the apparent distance of an object is determined in part by its clarity. The more sharply the object is seen, the closer it appears to be. This rule has some validity, because in any given scene the more distant objects are seen less sharply than nearer objects. However, the reliance on this rule leads to systematic errors in the estimation of distance. Specifically, distances are often overestimated  when visibility is poor because the contours of objects are blurred. On the other hand, distances are often underestimated when visibility is good because the objects are seen sharply. Thus, the reliance on clarity as an indication of distance leads to common biases. Such biases are also found in the intuitive judgment of probability. This article describes three heuristics that are employed  to assess probabilities and to predict values. Biases to which these heuristics  lead are enumerated, and the applied and theoretical implications of these observations are discussed. </p></div>

In answering such questions, people typically rely on the representativeness heuristic, in which probabilities are evaluated by the degree to which A is representative of B, that is, by the degree to which A resembles B. For example, when A is highly representative of B, the probability that A originates  from B is judged to be high.

A meek  and tidy soul, he has a need for order and structure, and a passion for detail.” How do people assess the probability that Steve is engaged in a particular occupation from a list of possibilities (for example, farmer, salesman, airline pilot, librarian, or physician)? How do people order these occupations from most to least likely? In the representativeness heuristic, the probability that Steve is  a librarian, for example, is assessed by the degree to which he is representative of, or similar to, the stereotype of a librarian. Indeed, research with problems of this type has shown that people order the occupations by probability and by similarity in exactly the same way. 1  This approach to the judgment of probability leads to serious errors, because similarity, or representativeness, is not  influenced by several factors that should affect judgments of probability. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Insensitivity to prior probability of outcomes . One of the factors that have no effect on representativeness but should have a major effect on probability is the prior probability, or base-rate frequency, of the outcomes. In the case of Steve, for example, the fact that there are many more farmers than librarians in the  population should enter into any reasonable estimate of the probability that Steve is a librarian rather than a farmer. Considerations of base-rate frequency, however, do not affect the similarity of Steve to the stereotypes of librarians and farmers. If people evaluate probability by representativeness, therefore, prior probabilities will be neglected. This hypothesis was tested in an experiment  where prior probabilities were manipulated. 2  Subjects were shown brief personality descriptions of several individuals, allegedly sampled at random from a group of 100 professionals—engineers and lawyers. The subjects were asked to assess, for each description, the probability that it belonged to an engineer rather than to a lawyer. In one experimental condition, subjects were told that the group  from which the descriptions had been drawn consisted of 70 engineers and 30 lawyers. In another condition, subjects were told that the group consisted of 30 engineers and 70 lawyers. The odds that any particular description belongs to an engineer rather than to a lawyer should be higher in the first condition, where there is a majority of engineers, than in the second condition, where there is  a majority of lawyers. Specifically, it can be shown by applying Bayes’ rule that the ratio of these odds should be (.7/.3) 2 , or 5.44, for each description. In a sharp violation of Bayes’ rule, the subjects in the two conditions produced essentially the same probability judgments. Apparently, subjects evaluated the likelihood that a particular description belonged to an engineer rather than to  a lawyer by the degree to which this description was  representative of the two stereotypes, with little or no regard for the prior probabilities of the categories. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Insensitivity to sample size . To evaluate the probability of obtaining a particular  result in a sample drawn from a specified population, people typically apply the representativeness heuristic. That is, they assess the likelihood of a sample result, for example, that the average height in a random sample of ten men will be 6 feet, by the similarity of this result to the corresponding parameter (that is, to the average height in the population of men). The similarity of a sample  statistic to a population parameter does not depend on the size of the sample. Consequently, if probabilities are assessed by representativeness, then the judged probability of a sample statistic will be essentially independent of sample size. Indeed, when subjects assessed the distributions of average height for samples of various sizes, they produced identical distributions. For example, the  probability of obtaining an average height greater than 6 feet was assigned the same value for samples of 1,000, 100, and 10 men. 4  Moreover, subjects failed to appreciate the role of sample size even when it was emphasized in the formulation of the problem.

In considering tosses of a coin for heads or tails, for example, people regard the sequence H-T-H-T-T-H to be more likely than the sequence H-H-H-T-T-T, which does not appear random, and also more likely than the sequence H-H-H-H-T-H, which does not represent the fairness of the coin. 7  Thus, people expect that the essential characteristics of the process will be  represented, not only globally in the entire sequence, but also locally in each of its parts. A locally representative sequence, however, deviates systematically from chance expectation: it contains too many alternations and too few runs. Another consequence of the belief in local representativeness is the well-known gambler’s fallacy. After observing a long run of red on the roulette wheel, for  example, most people erroneously believe that black is now due, presumably because the occurrence of black will result in a more representative sequence than the occurrence of an additional red. Chance is commonly viewed as a self-correcting process in which a deviation in one direction induces a deviation in the opposite direction to restore the equilibrium. In fact, deviations are not “corrected”  as a chance process unfolds, they are merely diluted. </p></div>

As we have seen, people often predict by selecting the outcome (for example, an occupation) that is most representative of the input (for example, the description of a person). The confidence they have in their prediction depends primarily on the degree of representativeness (that is, on the quality of the match between the selected outcome and the  input) with little or no regard for the factors that limit predictive accuracy. Thus, people express great confidence in the prediction that a person is a librarian when given a description of his personality which matches the stereotype of librarians, even if the description is scanty, unreliable, or outdated. The unwarranted confidence which is produced by a good fit between the predicted outcome  and the input information may be called the illusion of validity. This illusion persists even when the judge is aware of the factors that limit the accuracy of his predictions. It is a common observation that psychologists who conduct selection interviews often experience considerable confidence in their predictions, even when they know of the vast literature that shows selection interviews to  be highly fallible.

<p class ="en"> Biases in the evaluation of conjunctive and disjunctive events . In a recent study by Bar-Hillel 19  subjects were given the opportunity to bet on one of two  events. Three types of events were used: (i) simple events, such as drawing a red marble from a bag containing 50% red marbles and 50% white marbles; (ii) conjunctive events, such as drawing a red marble seven times in succession, with replacement, from a bag containing 90% red marbles and 10% white marbles; and (iii) disjunctive events, such as drawing a red marble at least once in seven successive  tries, with replacement, from a bag containing 10% red marbles and 90% white marbles. In this problem, a significant majority of subjects preferred to bet on the conjunctive event (the probability of which is .48) rather than on the simple event (the probability of which is .50). Subjects also preferred to bet on the simple event rather than on the disjunctive event, which has a probability  of .52. Thus, most subjects bet on the less likely event in both comparisons. This pattern of choices illustrates a general finding. Studies of choice among gambles and of judgments of probability indicate that people tend to overestimate the probability of conjunctive events 20  and to underestimate the probability of disjunctive events. These biases are readily explained as effects of anchoring.  The stated probability of the elementary event (success at any one stage) provides a natural starting point for the estimation of the probabilities of both conjunctive and disjunctive events. Since adjustment from the starting point is typically insufficient, the final estimates remain too close to the probabilities of the elementary events in both cases. Note that the overall probability of a  conjunctive event is lower than the probability of each elementary event, whereas the overall probability of a disjunctive event is higher than the probability of each elementary event. As a consequence of anchoring, the overall probability will be overestimated in conjunctive problems and underestimated in disjunctive problems. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Biases in the evaluation of compound events are particularly significant  in the context of planning. The successful completion of an undertaking, such as the development of a new product, typically has a conjunctive character: for the undertaking to succeed, each of a series of events must occur. Even when each of these events is very likely, the overall probability of success can be quite low if the number of events is large. The general tendency to overestimate  the probability of conjunctive events leads to unwarranted optimism in the evaluation of the likelihood that a plan will succeed or that a project will be completed on time. Conversely, disjunctive structures are typically encountered in the evaluation of risks. A complex system, such as a nuclear reactor or a human body, will malfunction if any of its essential components fails. Even when the  likelihood of failure in each component is slight, the probability of an overall failure can be high if many components are involved. Because of anchoring, people will tend to underestimate the probabilities of failure in complex systems. Thus, the direction of the anchoring bias can sometimes be inferred from the structure of the event. The chain-like structure of conjunctions leads to overestimation,  the funnel-like structure of disjunctions leads to underestimation. </p></div>

Although everyone is exposed, in the normal course of life, to numerous examples from which these rules could have been  induced, very few people discover the principles of sampling and regression on their own. Statistical principles are not learned from everyday experience because the relevant instances are not coded appropriately. For example, people do not discover that successive lines in a text differ more in average word length than do successive pages, because they simply do not attend to the average word length  of individual lines or pages.

Modern decision theory 24  regards subjective probability as the  quantified opinion of an idealized person.

An internally consistent, or coherent, subjective probability  measure can be derived for an individual if his choices among bets satisfy certain principles, that is, the axioms of the theory. The derived probability is subjective in the sense that different individuals are allowed to have different probabilities for the same event.

<p class ="cn"> 也许应该指出的是，虽然主观概率有时可以从投注的偏好中推断出来，但它们通常不是以这种方式形成的。一个人在A队而不是B队上下注，是因为他相信A队更有可能获胜；他并没有从他的投注偏好中推断出这种信念。  因此，在现实中，主观概率决定了投注的偏好，而不是像理性决策的公理理论那样，从投注中得出。 25 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The inherently subjective nature of probability has led many students to the belief that coherence, or internal consistency, is the only valid criterion by which judged probabilities should be evaluated. From the standpoint of the formal  theory of subjective probability, any set of internally consistent probability judgments is as good as any other. This criterion is not entirely satisfactory, because an internally consistent set of subjective probabilities can be incompatible with other beliefs held by the individual. Consider a person whose subjective probabilities for all possible outcomes of a coin-tossing game reflect the gambler’s  fallacy. That is, his estimate of the probability of tails on a particular toss increases with the number of consecutive heads that preceded that toss. The judgments of such a person could be internally consistent and therefore acceptable as adequate subjective probabilities according to the criterion of the formal theory. These probabilities, however, are incompatible with the generally held  belief that a coin has no memory and is therefore incapable of generating sequential dependencies. For judged probabilities to be considered adequate, or rational, internal consistency is not enough. The judgments must be compatible with the entire web of beliefs held by the individual. Unfortunately, there can be no simple formal procedure for assessing the compatibility of a set of probability  judgments with the judge’s total system of beliefs. The rational judge will nevertheless strive for compatibility, even though internal consistency is more easily achieved and assessed. In particular, he will attempt to make his probability judgments compatible with his knowledge about the subject matter, the laws of probability, and his own judgmental heuristics and biases. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 概率的内在主观性使许多学生相信，一致性或内部一致性是评价判断概率的唯一有效标准。从主观概率的正式  理论的角度来看，任何一组内部一致的概率判断都和其他任何概率判断一样好。这个标准并不完全令人满意，因为一套内部一致的主观概率可能与个人持有的其他信念不一致。考虑一个人，他对掷硬币游戏的所有可能结果的主观概率反映了赌徒的  谬误。也就是说，他对某次抛掷中出现尾巴的概率的估计会随着该次抛掷前连续出现的头像的数量而增加。这样一个人的判断可以是内部一致的，因此根据形式理论的标准，可以接受为充分的主观概率。然而，这些概率与普遍持有的  ，即硬币没有记忆，因此不能产生连续的依赖关系的信念不相容。要使判断的概率被认为是充分的，或者说是合理的，仅有内部一致性是不够的。判断必须与个人持有的整个信念网络相一致。不幸的是，不可能有简单的正式程序来评估一组概率  判断与法官的全部信仰系统的兼容性。不过，理性的法官还是会努力争取兼容性，尽管内部一致性更容易实现和评估。特别是，他将试图使他的概率判断与他关于主题事项的知识、概率规律以及他自己的判断启发式和偏见相兼容。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> This article  described three heuristics that are employed in making judgments under uncertainty: (i) representativeness, which is usually employed when people are asked to judge the probability that an object or event A belongs to class or process B; (ii) availability of instances or scenarios, which is often employed when people are asked to assess the frequency of a class or the plausibility of a particular  development; and (iii) adjustment from an anchor, which is usually employed in numerical prediction when a relevant value is available. These heuristics are highly economical and usually effective, but they lead to systematic and predictable errors. A better understanding of these heuristics and of the biases to which they lead could improve judgments and decisions in situations of uncertainty. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> ABSTRACT: We discuss the cognitive and the psychophysical determinants of choice in risky and riskless contexts. The psychophysics of value induce risk aversion in the domain of gains and risk seeking in the domain of losses. The psychophysics of chance induce overweighting of sure things and of improbable events, relative  to events of moderate probability. Decision problems can be described or framed in multiple ways that give rise to different preferences, contrary to the invariance criterion of rational choice. The process of mental accounting, in which people organize the outcomes of transactions, explains some anomalies of consumer behavior. In particular, the acceptability of an option can depend on whether  a negative outcome is evaluated as a cost or as an uncompensated loss. The relation between decision values and experience values is discussed . </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Making decisions is like speaking prose—people do it all the time, knowingly or unknowingly. It is hardly surprising, then, that the topic of decision making is shared by many disciplines, from mathematics and statistics, through economics and political  science, to sociology and psychology. The study of decisions addresses both normative and descriptive questions. The normative analysis is concerned with the nature of rationality and the logic of decision making. The descriptive analysis, in contrast, is concerned with people’s beliefs and preferences as they are, not as they should be. The tension between normative and descriptive considerations  characterizes much of the study of judgment and choice. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Analyses of decision making commonly distinguish risky and riskless choices. The paradigmatic example of decision under risk is the acceptability of a gamble that yields monetary outcomes with specified probabilities. A typical riskless decision concerns the acceptability of a transaction in which a good or a service is exchanged for money  or labor. In the first part of this article we present an analysis of the cognitive and psychophysical factors that determine the value of risky prospects. In the second part we extend this analysis to transactions and trades. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Risky  choices, such as whether or not to take an umbrella and whether or not to go to war, are made without advance knowledge of their consequences. Because  the consequences of such actions depend on uncertain events such as the weather or the opponent’s resolve, the choice of an act may be construed as the acceptance of a gamble that can yield various outcomes with different probabilities. It is therefore natural that the study of decision making under risk has focused on choices between simple gambles with monetary outcomes and specified probabilities,  in the hope that these simple problems will reveal basic attitudes toward risk and value. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> We shall sketch an approach to risky choice that derives many of its hypotheses from a psychophysical analysis of responses to money and to probability. The psychophysical approach to decision making can be traced to a remarkable essay that Daniel Bernoulli published in 1738 (Bernoulli 1954) in which he  attempted to explain why people are generally averse to risk and why risk aversion decreases with increasing wealth. To illustrate risk aversion and Bernoulli’s analysis, consider the choice between a prospect that offers an 85% chance to win $1,000 (with a 15% chance to win nothing) and the alternative of receiving $800 for sure. A large majority of people prefer the sure thing over the gamble, although  the gamble has higher (mathematical) expectation. The expectation of a monetary gamble is a weighted average, where each possible outcome is weighted by its probability of occurrence. The expectation of the gamble in this example is .85 × $1,000 + .15 × $0 = $850, which exceeds the expectation of $800 associated with the sure thing. The preference for the sure gain is an instance of risk aversion.  In general, a preference for a sure outcome over a gamble that has higher or equal expectation is called risk averse, and the rejection of a sure thing in favor of a gamble of lower or equal expectation is called risk seeking. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 我们将勾勒出一种研究风险选择的方法，它的许多假设来自于对金钱和概率反应的心理物理学分析。  决策的心理物理学方法可以追溯到丹尼尔-伯努利（Daniel Bernoulli）在1738年发表的一篇杰出的文章（Bernoulli 1954），他在文章中试图解释为什么人们普遍厌恶风险以及为什么风险厌恶会随着财富的增加而减少。为了说明风险厌恶和伯努利的分析，考虑在一个有85%的机会赢得1000美元（有15%的机会一无所获）的前景和一个肯定能得到800美元的选择之间进行选择。绝大多数人都喜欢稳赚不赔的东西，而不是赌博，尽管  ，赌博的期望值更高（数学）。货币赌博的期望值是一个加权平均值，每个可能的结果都按其发生的概率进行加权。在这个例子中，赌博的期望值是0.85×1,000美元+0.15×0美元=850美元，这超过了与肯定收益相关的800美元的期望值。对肯定收益的偏好是风险规避的一个实例。  一般来说，对确定的结果而不是对具有较高或相等期望值的赌博的偏好被称为风险厌恶，而拒绝确定的东西而选择较低或相等期望值的赌博被称为风险寻求。 </p></div>

<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Bernoulli suggested that people do not evaluate prospects by the expectation of their monetary outcomes, but rather by the expectation of the subjective value of these  outcomes. The subjective value of a gamble is again a weighted average, but now it is the subjective value of each outcome that is weighted by its probability. To explain risk aversion within this framework, Bernoulli proposed that subjective value, or utility, is a concave function of money. In such a function, the difference between the utilities of $200 and $100, for example, is greater than the  utility difference between $1,200 and $1,100. It follows from concavity that the subjective value attached to a gain of $800 is more than 80% of the value of a gain of $1,000. Consequently, the concavity of the utility function entails a risk averse preference for a sure gain of $800 over an 80% chance to win $1,000, although the two prospects have the same monetary expectation. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 伯努利提出，人们不是通过对其货币结果的预期来评估前景，而是通过对这些  结果的主观价值的预期。赌博的主观价值又是一个加权平均值，但现在是每个结果的主观价值被其概率所加权。为了在这个框架内解释风险厌恶，伯努利提出，主观价值或效用是一个货币的凹函数。在这样一个函数中，例如，200美元和100美元的效用之差，大于1200美元和1100美元的效用之差  。从凹性可以看出，800美元收益的主观价值是1000美元收益价值的80%以上。因此，效用函数的凹性意味着对800美元的肯定收益的风险厌恶，而不是对赢得1000美元的80%机会的风险厌恶，尽管这两种前景具有相同的货币预期。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> It is customary  in decision analysis to describe the outcomes of decisions in terms of total wealth. For example, an offer to bet $20 on the toss of a fair coin is represented as a choice between an individual’s current wealth  W  and an even chance to move to  W  + $20 or to  W  − $20. This representation appears psychologically unrealistic: People do not normally think of relatively small outcomes in terms of states  of wealth but rather in terms of gains, losses, and neutral outcomes (such as the maintenance of the status quo). If the effective carriers of subjective value are changes of wealth rather than ultimate states of wealth, as we propose, the psychophysical analysis of outcomes should be applied to gains and losses rather than to total assets. This assumption plays a central role in a treatment of  risky choice that we called prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). Introspection as well as psychophysical measurements suggest  that subjective value is a concave function of the size of a gain. The same generalization applies to losses as well. The difference in subjective value between a loss of $200 and a loss of $100 appears greater than the difference in subjective value between a loss  of $1,200 and a loss of $1,100. When the value functions for gains and for losses are pieced together, we obtain an S-shaped function of the type displayed in  Figure 1 . </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 在决策分析中，习惯于  ，用总财富来描述决策的结果。例如，在抛出一枚公平的硬币上押注20美元的提议被表示为在个人当前的财富 W 和移动到 W +20美元或 W -20美元的偶数机会之间的选择。这种表述在心理学上似乎是不现实的。人们通常不会从财富的状态  ，而是从收益、损失和中性结果（如维持现状）的角度来考虑相对较小的结果。如果主观价值的有效载体是财富的变化，而不是财富的最终状态，正如我们所提议的那样，对结果的心理物理分析应该适用于收益和损失，而不是总资产。这一假设在我们称之为前景理论（Kahneman and Tversky 1979）的对  风险选择的处理中起到了核心作用。自省以及心理物理测量表明 ，主观价值是收益大小的一个凹函数。同样的概括也适用于损失。损失200美元和损失100美元之间的主观价值差异似乎比损失1200美元  和损失1100美元之间的主观价值差异更大。当收益和损失的价值函数被拼凑在一起时，我们得到一个 图1 中显示的S型函数。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The value function shown in  Figure 1  is (a) defined on gains and losses rather than on total wealth, (b) concave in the domain of gains and convex in the domain of losses, and (c) considerably steeper for losses than for gains. The last property, which we label  loss aversion , expresses the intuition that a loss of $X is more aversive than a gain of $X  is attractive. Loss aversion explains people’s reluctance to bet on a fair coin for equal stakes: The attractiveness of the possible gain is not nearly sufficient to compensate for the aversiveness of the possible loss.

<p class ="en"> The assumption of risk aversion has  played a central role in economic theory. However, just as the concavity of the value of gains entails risk aversion, the convexity of the value of losses entails risk seeking. Indeed, risk seeking in losses is a robust effect, particularly when the probabilities of loss are substantial. Consider, for example, a situation in which an individual is forced to choose between an 85% chance to lose $1,000  (with a 15% chance to lose nothing) and a sure loss of $800. A large majority of people express a preference for the gamble over the sure loss. This is a risk seeking choice because the expectation of the gamble (−$850) is inferior to the expectation of the sure loss (−$800). Risk seeking in the domain of losses has been confirmed by several investigators (Fishburn and Kochenberger 1979; Hershey  and Schoemaker 1980; Payne, Laughhunn, and Crum 1980; Slovic, Fischhoff, and Lichtenstein 1982). It has also been observed with nonmonetary outcomes, such as hours of pain (Eraker and Sox 1981) and loss of human lives (Fischhoff 1983; Tversky 1977; Tversky and Kahneman 1981). Is it wrong to be risk averse in the domain of gains and risk seeking in the domain of losses? These preferences conform  to compelling intuitions about the subjective value of gains and losses, and the presumption is that people should be entitled to their own values. However, we shall see that an S-shaped value function has implications that are normatively unacceptable. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> To  address the normative issue we turn from psychology to decision theory. Modern decision theory can be said to begin with the pioneering work  of von Neumann and Morgenstern (1947), who laid down several qualitative principles, or axioms, that should govern the preferences of a rational decision maker. Their axioms included transitivity (if A is preferred to B and B is preferred to C, then A is preferred to C), and substitution (if A is preferred to B, then an even chance to get A or C is preferred to an even chance to get B or C), along  with other conditions of a more technical nature. The normative and the descriptive status of the axioms of rational choice have been the subject of extensive discussions. In particular, there is convincing evidence that people do not always obey the substitution axiom, and considerable disagreement exists about the normative merit of this axiom (e.g., Allais and Hagen 1979). However, all analyses  of rational choice incorporate two principles: dominance and invariance. Dominance demands that if prospect A is at least as good as prospect B in every respect and better than B in at least one respect, then A should be preferred to B. Invariance requires that the preference order between prospects should not depend on the manner in which they are described. In particular, two versions of a  choice problem that are recognized to be equivalent when shown together should elicit the same preference even when shown separately. We now show that the requirement of invariance, however elementary and innocuous it may seem, cannot generally be satisfied. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The moral of these results is disturbing: Invariance is normatively essential, intuitively compelling, and psychologically unfeasible. Indeed, we conceive only two ways of guaranteeing invariance. The first is to adopt a procedure that will transform equivalent versions of any problem into the same canonical representation. This is the rationale for the standard admonition to students  of business, that they should consider each decision problem in terms of total assets rather than in terms of gains or losses (Schlaifer 1959). Such a representation would avoid the violations of invariance illustrated in the previous problems, but the advice is easier to give than to follow. Except in the context of possible ruin, it is more natural to consider financial outcomes as gains and  losses rather than as states of wealth. Furthermore, a canonical representation of risky prospects requires a compounding of all outcomes of concurrent decisions (e.g., Problem 4) that exceeds the capabilities of intuitive computation even in simple problems. Achieving a canonical representation is even more difficult in other contexts such as safety, health, or quality of life. Should we advise  people to evaluate the consequence of a public health policy (e.g., Problems 1 and 2) in terms of overall mortality, mortality due to diseases, or the number of deaths associated with the particular disease under study? </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 这些结果的寓意是令人不安的。不变性在规范上是必要的，在直觉上是令人信服的，在心理上是不可行的。事实上，我们只设想了两种保证不变性的方法。第一种是采用一种程序，将任何问题的等价版本转化为相同的典范表示。这就是对学生的标准告诫的理由  ，即他们应该从总资产的角度而不是从收益或损失的角度考虑每个决策问题（Schlaifer 1959）。这样的表述可以避免前面问题中说明的违反不变性的情况，但这个建议说起来容易，做起来难。除了在可能毁灭的情况下，将金融结果视为收益和  损失，而不是财富的状态，是比较自然的。此外，风险前景的典型表示需要对所有同时发生的决策结果进行复合（例如，问题4），即使在简单的问题中也超出了直觉计算的能力。在其他情况下，如安全、健康或生活质量，实现典型代表甚至更加困难。我们是否应该建议  ，以总体死亡率、疾病死亡率或与所研究的特定疾病相关的死亡人数来评估一项公共卫生政策的后果（例如问题1和2）？ </p></div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Another approach that could guarantee invariance is the evaluation of options in terms of their actuarial rather than their psychological consequences. The actuarial criterion  has some appeal in the context of human lives, but it is clearly inadequate for financial choices, as has been generally recognized at least since Bernoulli, and it is entirely inapplicable to outcomes that lack an objective metric. We conclude that frame invariance cannot be expected to hold and that a sense of confidence in a particular choice does not ensure that the same choice would be made  in another frame. It is therefore good practice to test the robustness of preferences by deliberate attempts to frame a decision problem in more than one way (Fischhoff, Slovic, and Lichtenstein 1980). </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 另一种可以保证不变性的方法是用精算而不是心理后果来评价选择。精算标准  ，在人类生活的背景下有一定的吸引力，但对于财务选择来说显然是不够的，至少自伯努利以来人们普遍认识到了这一点，而且它完全不适用于缺乏客观尺度的结果。我们的结论是，不能指望框架不变性成立，对某一特定选择的信心感并不能确保在另一个框架中也会做出同样的选择  。因此，通过刻意尝试以一种以上的方式设定决策问题来测试偏好的稳健性是一种很好的做法（Fischhoff, Slovic, and Lichtenstein 1980）。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Our discussion so far has assumed a Bernoullian expectation rule according to which the value, or utility, of an uncertain prospect is obtained by adding the utilities  of the possible outcomes, each weighted by its probability. To examine this assumption, let us again consult psychophysical intuitions. Setting the value of the status quo at zero, imagine a cash gift, say of $300, and assign it a value of one. Now imagine that you are only given a ticket to a lottery that has a single prize of $300. How does the value of the ticket vary as a function of the probability  of winning the prize? Barring utility for gambling, the value of such a prospect must vary between zero (when the chance of winning is nil) and one (when winning $300 is a certainty). </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 到目前为止，我们的讨论已经假设了伯努利的期望规则，根据该规则，不确定前景的价值或效用是通过将可能的结果的效用  ，每个结果按其概率加权得到的。为了研究这个假设，让我们再次参考心理物理学的直觉。将现状的价值设定为零，想象一个现金礼物，例如300美元，并赋予它1的价值。现在想象一下，你只得到了一张彩票，而这张彩票有300美元的单一奖金。这张彩票的价值是如何随着中奖概率的变化而变化的  ？如果不考虑赌博的效用，这种前景的价值必须在零（当中奖的机会为零时）和一（当赢得300美元是肯定的）之间变化。 </p></div>

<div class ="bottom">

<p class ="en"> Intuition suggests that the value of the ticket is not a linear function of the probability of winning, as entailed by the expectation rule. In particular, an increase from 0% to 5% appears to have a larger effect  than an increase from 30% to 35%, which also appears smaller than an increase from 95% to 100%. These considerations suggest a category-boundary effect: A change from impossibility to possibility or from possibility to certainty has a bigger impact than a comparable change in the middle of the scale. This hypothesis is incorporated into the curve displayed  in  Figure 2 , which plots the weight attached  to an event as a function of its stated numerical probability. The most salient feature of  Figure 2  is that decision weights are regressive with respect to stated probabilities. Except near the endpoints, an increase of .05 in the probability of winning increases the value of the prospect by less than 5% of the value of the prize. We next investigate the implications of these psychophysical hypotheses  for preferences among risky options. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 直觉表明，彩票的价值并不是中奖概率的线性函数，正如预期规则所要求的那样。特别是，从0%增加到5%似乎比从30%增加到35%有更大的影响  ，而后者也似乎比从95%增加到100%小。这些考虑表明了一个类别的边界效应。从不可能到可能或从可能到肯定的变化，比规模中间的可比变化有更大的影响。这一假设被纳入了 图2 中显示的曲线 ，该曲线将一个事件的权重  ，作为其所述数字概率的函数。 图2 最突出的特点是，决策权重相对于陈述的概率而言是递减的。除了在终点附近，获胜概率每增加0.05，前景的价值就会增加不到奖金价值的5%。我们接下来研究这些心理物理学假设的影响  ，以了解风险选项的偏好。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In  Figure 2 , decision weights are lower than the corresponding probabilities over most of the range. Underweighting of moderate and high probabilities relative to sure things contributes to risk aversion in gains by reducing the attractiveness of positive gambles. The same effect also contributes to risk seeking in losses by attenuating the aversiveness  of negative gambles. Low probabilities, however, are overweighted, and very low probabilities are either overweighted quite grossly or neglected altogether, making the decision weights highly unstable in that region. The overweighting of low probabilities reverses the pattern described above: It enhances the value of long shots and amplifies the aversiveness of a small chance of a severe loss.  Consequently, people are often risk seeking in dealing with improbable gains and risk averse in dealing with unlikely losses. Thus, the characteristics of decision weights contribute to the attractiveness of both lottery tickets and insurance policies. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 在 图2 中，决策权重在大部分范围内都低于相应的概率。相对于确定的事情，中等和高概率的权重过低，通过减少正面赌博的吸引力，有助于在收益中规避风险。同样的效果也有助于在损失中寻求风险，因为它削弱了消极赌博的厌恶感  。然而，低概率会被加权，非常低的概率要么被严重加权，要么被完全忽略，使得决策权重在该区域非常不稳定。对低概率的加权扭转了上述的模式。它提高了长线投资的价值，放大了小概率严重损失的反作用。  因此，人们在处理不可能的收益时往往会寻求风险，而在处理不可能的损失时则会厌恶风险。因此，决策权重的特点促成了彩票和保险单的吸引力。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> We attribute the failure of invariance to the interaction of two factors: the framing of probabilities and the nonlinearity of decision weights. More specifically, we propose that in Problem 5 people ignore the first phase, which yields the same outcome regardless of the decision that is made, and focus  their attention on what happens if they do reach the second stage of the game. In that case, of course, they face a sure gain if they choose option A and an 80% chance of winning if they prefer to gamble. Indeed, people’s choices in the sequential version are practically identical to the choices they make between a sure gain of $30 and an 85% chance to win $45. Because a sure thing is overweighted  in comparison with events of moderate or high probability (see  figure 2 ), the option that may lead to a gain of $30 is more attractive in the sequential version. We call this phenomenon the pseudo-certainty effect because an event that is actually uncertain is weighted as if it were certain. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> A closely related phenomenon can be demonstrated at the low end of the probability range. Suppose you  are undecided whether or not to purchase earthquake insurance because the premium is quite high. As you hesitate, your friendly insurance agent comes forth with an alternative offer: “For half the regular premium you can be fully covered if the quake occurs on an odd day of the month. This is a good deal because for half the price you are covered for more than half the days.” Why do most people find  such probabilistic insurance distinctly unattractive?  Figure 2  suggests an answer. Starting anywhere in the region of low probabilities, the impact on the decision weight of a reduction of probability from  p  to  p /2 is considerably smaller than the effect of a reduction from  p /2 to 0. Reducing the risk by half, then, is not worth half the premium. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The aversion to probabilistic insurance is significant  for three reasons. First, it undermines the classical explanation of insurance in terms of a concave utility function. According to expected utility theory, probabilistic insurance should be definitely preferred to normal insurance when the latter is just acceptable (see Kahneman and Tversky 1979). Second, probabilistic insurance represents many forms of protective action, such as having  a medical checkup, buying new tires, or installing a burglar alarm system. Such actions typically reduce the probability of some hazard without eliminating it altogether. Third, the acceptability of insurance can be manipulated by the framing of the contingencies. An insurance policy that covers fire but not flood, for example, could be evaluated either as full protection against a specific risk (e.g.,  fire), or as a reduction in the overall probability of property loss.  Figure 2  suggests that people greatly undervalue a reduction in the probability of a hazard in comparison to the complete elimination of that hazard. Hence, insurance should appear more attractive when it is framed as the elimination of risk than when it is described as a reduction of risk. Indeed, Slovic, Fischhoff,  and Lichtenstein  (1982) showed that a hypothetical vaccine that reduces the probability of contracting a disease from 20% to 10% is less attractive if it is described as effective in half of the cases than if it is presented as fully effective against one of two exclusive and equally probable virus strains that produce identical symptoms. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 对概率性保险的厌恶是重要的  ，原因有三。首先，它破坏了以凹形效用函数来解释保险的经典方法。根据预期效用理论，当正常保险只是可以接受时，概率性保险应该肯定比正常保险更受欢迎（见Kahneman和Tversky 1979）。其次，概率保险代表了许多形式的保护性行动，例如有  体检，购买新轮胎，或安装防盗报警系统。这种行动通常会减少一些危险的概率，而不会完全消除它。第三，保险的可接受性可以通过突发事件的框架来操纵。例如，一份包括火灾但不包括水灾的保险可以被评估为对某一特定风险的全面保护（例如，  火灾），或者被评估为对财产损失的总体概率的降低。 图2 表明，与完全消除危险相比，人们大大低估了减少危险概率的价值。因此，当保险被描述为消除风险时，应该比被描述为减少风险时更有吸引力。事实上，Slovic, Fischhoff, and Lichtenstein  (1982)表明，一种假设的疫苗，如果被描述为对一半的病例有效，那么它的吸引力就不如被描述为对两种产生相同症状的、可能性相同的病毒株之一完全有效。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> So far we have discussed framing as a tool to demonstrate  failures of invariance. We now turn attention to the processes that control the framing of outcomes and events. The public health problem illustrates a formulation effect in which a change of wording from “lives saved” to “lives lost” induced a marked shift of preference from risk aversion to risk seeking. Evidently, the subjects adopted the descriptions of the outcomes as given in the question  and evaluated the outcomes accordingly as gains or losses. Another formulation effect was reported by McNeil, Pauker, Sox, and Tversky (1982). They found that preferences of physicians and patients between hypothetical therapies for lung cancer varied markedly when their probable outcomes were described in terms of mortality or survival. Surgery, unlike radiation therapy, entails a risk of death  during treatment. As a consequence, the surgery option was relatively less attractive when the statistics of treatment outcomes were described in terms of mortality rather than in terms of survival. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 到目前为止，我们已经讨论了作为证明  不变性的失败的工具的框架。我们现在把注意力转向控制结果和事件的框架的过程。公共卫生问题说明了一种表述效果，即把措辞从 "拯救的生命 "改为 "失去的生命"，就会使人们的偏好从厌恶风险转向寻求风险。显然，被试采用了问题中对结果的描述  ，并相应地将结果评价为收益或损失。McNeil、Pauker、Sox和Tversky（1982）报告了另一种表述效果。他们发现，当肺癌的可能结果被描述为死亡率或存活率时，医生和病人对假想疗法的偏好有明显的不同。手术与放疗不同，在治疗期间会有死亡的风险  。因此，当治疗结果的统计数字是以死亡率而不是以生存率来描述时，手术方案的吸引力相对较小。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> A physician, and perhaps a presidential advisor as well, could influence the decision made by the patient or by the President, without distorting or suppressing information, merely by the framing  of outcomes and contingencies. Formulation effects can occur fortuitously, without anyone being aware of the impact of the frame on the ultimate decision. They can also be exploited deliberately to manipulate the relative attractiveness of options. For example, Thaler (1980) noted that lobbyists for the credit card industry insisted that any price difference between cash and credit purchases be labeled  a cash discount rather than a credit card surcharge. The two labels frame the price difference as a gain or as a loss by implicitly designating either the lower or the higher price as normal. Because losses loom larger than gains, consumers are less likely to accept a surcharge than to forgo a discount. As is to be expected, attempts to influence framing are common in the marketplace and in  the political arena. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The evaluation of outcomes is susceptible to formulation effects because of the nonlinearity of the value function and the tendency of people to evaluate options in relation to the reference point that is suggested or implied by the statement of the problem. It is worthy of note that in other contexts people automatically transform equivalent messages into the same representation.  Studies of language comprehension indicate that people quickly recode much of what they hear into an abstract representation that no longer distinguishes whether the idea was expressed in an active or in a passive form and no longer discriminates what was actually said from what was implied, presupposed, or implicated (Clark and Clark 1977). Unfortunately, the mental machinery that performs  these operations silently and effortlessly is not adequate to perform the task of recoding the two versions of the public health problem or the mortality survival statistics into a common abstract form. </p></div>

Thus, an option is acceptable if the value of its advantages  exceeds the value of its disadvantages.

In the preceding problem, the relevant topic is the purchase of the calculator, and the benefit of the trip is therefore framed as a reduction of the price, from $15 to $10. Because the potential saving is associated only with the calculator, the price of the jacket is not included in the topical account.

We suggest, however, that people will spontaneously frame decisions in terms of topical accounts that, in the  context of decision making, play a role analogous to that of “good forms” in perception and of basic-level categories in cognition. Topical organization, in conjunction with the concavity of value, entails that the willingness to travel to the other store for a saving of $5 on a calculator should be inversely related to the price of the calculator and should be independent of the price of the jacket.  To test this prediction, we constructed another version of the problem in which the prices of the two items were interchanged. The price of the calculator was given as $125 in the first store and $120 in the other branch, and the price of the jacket was set at $15. As predicted, the proportions of respondents who said they would make the trip differed sharply in the two problems. The results  showed that 68% of the respondents ( N  = 88) were willing to drive to the other branch to save $5 on a $15 calculator, but only 29% of 93 respondents were willing to make the same trip to save $5 on a $125 calculator.

Most consumers will find it easier to buy a car stereo system or a Persian rug, respectively, in the context of buying a car or a house than separately.

Why are so many people unwilling to spend $10 after having lost  a ticket, if they would readily spend that sum after losing an equivalent amount of cash? We attribute the difference to the topical organization of mental accounts. Going to the theater is normally viewed as a transaction in which the cost of the ticket is exchanged for the experience of seeing the play. Buying a second ticket increases the cost of seeing the play to a level that many respondents  apparently find unacceptable. In contrast, the loss of the cash is not posted to the account of the play, and it affects the purchase of a ticket only by making the individual feel slightly less affluent. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The normative status of the effects of mental accounting is questionable. Unlike  earlier examples, such as the public health problem, in which the two versions differed only in form, it can be argued that the alternative versions of the calculator and ticket problems differ also in substance. In particular, it may be more pleasurable to save $5 on a $15 purchase than on a  larger purchase, and it may be more annoying to pay twice for the same ticket than to lose $10 in cash.  Regret, frustration, and self-satisfaction can also be affected by framing (Kahneman and Tversky 1982). If such secondary consequences are considered legitimate, then the observed preferences do not violate the criterion of invariance and cannot readily be ruled out as inconsistent or erroneous. On the other hand, secondary consequences may change upon reflection. The satisfaction of saving $5 on  a $15 item can be marred if the consumer discovers that she would not have exerted the same effort to save $10 on a $200 purchase. We do not wish to recommend that any two decision problems that have the same primary consequences should be resolved in the same way. We propose, however, that systematic examination of alternative framings offers a useful reflective device that can help decision makers  assess the values that should be attached to the primary and secondary consequences of their choices. </p></div>

The analysis of value that was applied earlier to unidimensional risky prospects can be  extended to this case by assuming that the status quo defines the reference level for all attributes.

<p class ="en"> Thaler (1980) coined the term “endowment effect” to describe the reluctance of  people to part from assets that belong to their endowment. When it is more painful to give up an asset than it is pleasurable to obtain it, buying prices will be significantly lower than selling prices. That is, the highest price that an individual will pay to acquire an asset will be smaller than the minimal compensation that would induce the same individual to give up that asset, once acquired.  Thaler discussed some examples of the endowment effect in the behavior of consumers and entrepreneurs. Several studies have reported substantial discrepancies between buying and selling prices in both hypothetical and real transactions (Gregory 1983; Hammack and Brown 1974; Knetsch and Sinden 1984). These results have been presented as challenges to standard economic theory, in which buying and  selling prices coincide except for transaction costs and effects of wealth. We also observed reluctance to trade in a study of choices between hypothetical jobs that differed in weekly salary ( S ) and in the temperature ( T ) of the workplace. Our respondents were asked to imagine that they held a particular position ( S 1 ,  T 1 ) and were offered the option of moving to a different position ( S 2 ,  T 2 ),  which was better in one respect and worse in another. We found that most subjects who were assigned to ( S 1 ,  T 1 ) did not wish to move to ( S 2 ,  T 2 ), and that most subjects who were assigned to the latter position did not wish to move to the former. Evidently, the same difference in pay or in working conditions looms larger as a disadvantage than as an advantage. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> Thaler（1980）创造了 "禀赋效应 "一词来描述  ，人们不愿意放弃属于他们禀赋的资产。当放弃一项资产比获得它的乐趣更痛苦时，购买价格将大大低于销售价格。也就是说，一个人为了获得一项资产所付出的最高价格将小于促使同一个人在获得该资产后放弃该资产的最低补偿。  Thaler讨论了消费者和企业家行为中的禀赋效应的一些例子。一些研究报告称，在假设的和真实的交易中，购买和销售价格之间存在巨大的差异（Gregory 1983；Hammack and Brown 1974；Knetsch and Sinden 1984）。这些结果被认为是对标准经济理论的挑战，在这些理论中，除了交易成本和财富效应外，购买和  销售价格是一致的。我们还在一项研究中观察到，在周薪 （S ）和工作场所温度 （T ）不同的假想工作之间选择交易的意愿。我们的受访者被要求想象他们担任一个特定的职位 （ S1 ， T1 ），并被提供选择转移到一个不同的职位 （S2 ， T2 ），  ，这个职位在某方面更好，在另方面更差。我们发现，大多数被分配到 （ S1 ， T1 ）的受试者不希望转到 （S2 ， T2 ），而大多数被分配到后一个职位的受试者也不希望转到前一个职位。显而易见，同样的薪酬或工作条件的差异，作为一种劣势比作为一种优势更明显。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In general, loss aversion favors  stability over change. Imagine two hedonically identical twins who find two alternative environments equally attractive. Imagine further that by force of circumstance the twins are separated and placed in the two environments. As soon as they adopt their new states as reference points and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each other’s environments accordingly, the twins will no longer be  indifferent between the two states, and both will prefer to stay where they happen to be. Thus, the instability of preferences  produces a preference for stability. In addition to favoring stability over change, the combination of adaptation and loss aversion provides limited protection against regret and envy by reducing the attractiveness of foregone alternatives and of others’ endowments. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Loss aversion and the consequent endowment effect are unlikely to play a significant role in routine economic exchanges. The owner of a store, for example, does not experience money paid to suppliers as losses and money received from customers as gains. Instead, the merchant adds costs and revenues over some period of time and only evaluates the balance. Matching debits and credits are effectively  canceled prior to evaluation. Payments made by consumers are also not evaluated as losses but as alternative purchases. In accord with standard economic analysis, money is naturally viewed as a proxy for the goods and services that it could buy. This mode of evaluation is made explicit when an individual has in mind a particular alternative, such as, “I can either buy a new camera or a new tent.”  In this analysis, a person will buy a camera if its subjective value exceeds the value of retaining the money it would cost. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 损失规避和随之而来的禀赋效应不太可能在常规经济交流中发挥重要作用。例如，商店的老板不会把支付给供应商的钱当作损失，把从顾客那里得到的钱当作收益。相反，商人在一段时间内增加成本和收入，只对余额进行评估。匹配的借方和贷方在评估前有效地  ，取消了。消费者的付款也没有被评估为损失，而是被评估为替代购买。根据标准的经济分析，货币自然被视为它可以购买的商品和服务的代表。当一个人心中有一个特定的替代物时，这种评价模式就明确了，例如，"我要么买一个新的相机，要么买一个新的帐篷。"  在这种分析中，如果一个人的主观价值超过了保留它所花费的钱的价值，他就会购买一台相机。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> There are cases in which a disadvantage can be framed either as a cost or as a loss. In particular, the purchase of insurance can also be framed as a choice between a sure loss and the risk of a greater loss. In such cases the cost-loss discrepancy can lead to failures  of invariance. Consider, for example, the choice between a sure loss of $50 and a 25% chance to lose $200. Slovic, Fischhoff, and Lichtenstein (1982) reported that 80% of their subjects expressed a risk-seeking preference for the gamble over the sure loss. However, only 35% of subjects refused to pay $50 for insurance against a 25% risk of losing $200. Similar results were also reported by Schoemaker  and Kunreuther (1979) and by Hershey and Schoemaker (1980). We suggest that the same amount of money that was framed as an uncompensated loss in the first problem was framed as the cost of protection in the second. The modal preference was reversed in the two problems because losses are more aversive than costs. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The preceding analysis implies that an individual’s subjective state can be improved by framing negative outcomes as costs rather than as losses. The possibility of such psychological manipulations may explain a paradoxical form of behavior that could be labeled  the dead-loss effect. Thaler (1980) discussed the example of a man who develops tennis elbow soon after paying  the membership fee in a tennis club and continues to play in agony to avoid wasting his investment. Assuming that the individual would not play if he had not paid the membership fee, the question arises: How can playing in agony improve the individual’s lot? Playing in pain, we suggest,  maintains the evaluation of the membership fee as a cost. If the individual were to stop playing, he would be forced to recognize the fee as a dead loss, which may be more aversive than playing in pain. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 结语 </p></div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> The concepts of utility and value are commonly used in two distinct senses: (a) experience value, the degree of pleasure or pain, satisfaction or anguish in the actual experience  of an outcome; and (b) decision value, the contribution of an anticipated outcome to the overall attractiveness or aversiveness of an option in a choice. The distinction is rarely explicit in decision theory because it is tacitly assumed that decision values and experience values coincide. This assumption is part of the conception of an idealized decision maker who is able to predict future  experiences with perfect accuracy and evaluate options accordingly. For ordinary decision makers, however, the correspondence of decision values between experience values is far from perfect (March 1978). Some factors that affect experience are not easily anticipated, and some factors that affect decisions do not have a comparable impact on the experience of outcomes. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 功用和价值的概念通常在两种不同的意义上使用：(a) 经验价值，在实际体验中的快乐或痛苦、满意或痛苦的程度  ；(b) 决策价值，在选择中预期结果对选项的总体吸引力或反作用的贡献。这种区分在决策理论中很少明确，因为人们默认决策价值和经验价值是一致的。这一假设是理想化的决策者概念的一部分，他能够完全准确地预测未来的  ，并据此评估各种选择。然而，对于普通的决策者来说，决策值与经验值的对应关系远非完美（March 1978）。一些影响经验的因素不容易被预测，而一些影响决策的因素对结果经验的影响也不具有可比性。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In contrast to the large  amount of research on decision making, there has been relatively little systematic exploration of the psychophysics that relate hedonic experience to objective states. The most basic problem of hedonic psychophysics is the determination of the level of adaptation or aspiration that separates positive from negative outcomes. The hedonic reference point is largely determined by the objective status  quo, but it is also affected by expectations and social comparisons. An objective improvement can be experienced as a loss, for example, when an employee receives a smaller raise than everyone else in the office. The experience of pleasure or pain associated with a change of state is also critically dependent on the dynamics of hedonic adaptation. Brickman and Campbell’s (1971) concept of the hedonic  treadmill suggests the radical hypothesis that rapid adaptation will cause the effects of any objective improvement to be short-lived. The complexity and subtlety of hedonic experience make it difficult for the decision maker to anticipate the actual experience that outcomes will produce. Many a person who ordered a meal when ravenously hungry has admitted to a big mistake when the fifth course  arrived on the table. The common mismatch of decision values and experience values introduces an additional element of uncertainty in many decision problems. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 与关于决策的大量  ，相对而言，对于将享乐体验与客观状态联系起来的心理物理学的系统探索却很少。享乐心理物理学的最基本问题是确定适应或渴望的程度，以区分积极和消极的结果。享乐参考点在很大程度上是由客观状态  quo决定的，但它也受到期望和社会比较的影响。一个客观的改善可以被体验为一种损失，例如，当一个雇员得到的加薪比办公室里的其他人少。与状态变化相关的快乐或痛苦的体验也关键取决于享乐适应的动态。Brickman和Campbell(1971)的hedonic  treadmill的概念提出了一个激进的假设，即快速的适应会导致任何客观改善的效果都是短暂的。享乐体验的复杂性和微妙性使得决策者很难预测结果将产生的实际体验。许多人在饥肠辘辘的时候点了一餐，当第五道菜  ，就承认犯了大错。决策价值和经验价值的普遍不匹配在许多决策问题中引入了一个额外的不确定性因素。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> The prevalence of framing effects and violations of invariance further complicates the relation between decision values and experience values. The framing of outcomes often induces decision values that have no counterpart in actual experience.  For example, the framing of outcomes of therapies for lung cancer in terms of mortality or survival is unlikely to affect experience, although it can have a pronounced influence on choice. In other cases, however, the framing of decisions affects not only decision but experience as well. For example, the framing of an expenditure as an uncompensated loss or as the price of insurance can probably  influence the experience of that outcome. In such cases, the evaluation of outcomes in the context of decisions not only anticipates experience but also molds it. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 框定效应和违反不变性的普遍存在，使决策价值和经验价值之间的关系更加复杂。对结果的框定往往会诱发在实际经验中没有对应的决策价值。  例如，以死亡率或生存率来框定肺癌治疗的结果，不太可能影响经验，尽管它对选择有明显的影响。然而，在其他情况下，决策的框架不仅影响决策，也影响经验。例如，把一项支出说成是无偿的损失或保险的价格，可能会影响到该结果的经验，  。在这种情况下，在决定的背景下对结果的评价不仅预示着经验，而且也塑造了经验。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Attention and Effort : Much of the material of this chapter draws on my  Attention and Effort  (1973). It is available for free download on my website ( www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/docs/attention_and_effort/Attention_hi_quality.pdf ). The main theme  of that book is the idea of a limited ability to pay attention and exert mental effort. Attention and effort were considered general resources that could be used to support many mental tasks. The idea of general capacity is controversial, but it has been extended by other psychologists and neuroscientists, who found support for it in brain research. See Marcel A. Just and Patricia A. Carpenter, “A  Capacity Theory of Comprehension: Individual Differences in Working Memory,”  Psychological Review  99 (1992): 122–49; Marcel A. Just et al., “Neuroindices of Cognitive Workload: Neuroimaging, Pupillometric and Event-Related Potential Studies of Brain Work,”  Theoretical Issues in Ergonomics Science  4 (2003): 56–88. There is also growing experimental evidence for general-purpose resources of attention,  as in Evie Vergauwe et al., “Do Mental Processes Share a Domain-General Resource?”  Psychological Science  21 (2010): 384–90. There is imaging evidence that the mere anticipation of a high-effort task mobilizes activity in many areas of the brain, relative to a low-effort task of the same kind. Carsten N. Boehler et al., “Task-Load-Dependent Activation of Dopaminergic Midbrain Areas in the Absence  of Reward,”  Journal of Neuroscience  31 (2011): 4955–61. </p></div>

Just和Patricia A. Carpenter, "A  Capacity Theory of Comprehension:工作记忆的个体差异》，《 心理学评论》 99（1992）。122-49；Marcel A.

<p class ="en"> Much like the electricity meter : Attempting to perform several tasks at once may run into difficulties of several kinds. For example, it is physically impossible to say two different things at exactly the same time, and it may be easier to combine an auditory and a visual task than to combine two visual or two auditory tasks. Prominent psychological theories have  attempted to attribute all mutual interference between tasks to competition for separate mechanisms. See Alan D. Baddeley,  Working Memory  (New York: Oxford University Press, 1986). With practice, people’s ability to multitask in specific ways may improve. However, the wide variety of very different tasks that interfere with each other supports the existence of a general resource of attention or  effort that is necessary in many tasks. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The impression of familiarity : Normally,  when you meet a friend you can immediately place and name him; you often know  where you met him last, what he was wearing, and what you said to each other. The feeling of familiarity becomes relevant only when such specific memories are not available. It is a fallback. Although its reliability is imperfect, the fallback is much better than nothing. It is the sense of familiarity that protects you from the embarrassment of being (and acting) astonished when you are greeted  as an old friend by someone who only looks vaguely familiar. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> an intuitive answer to it came readily to mind : An alternative approach to judgment heuristics has been proposed by Gerd Gigerenzer,  Peter M. Todd, and the ABC Research Group, in  Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart  (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999). They describe “fast and frugal” formal procedures such as “Take the best [cue],” which under some circumstances generate quite accurate judgments on the basis of little information. As Gigerenzer has emphasized, his heuristics are different from those that Amos and I studied,  and he has stressed their accuracy rather than the biases to which they inevitably lead. Much of the research that supports fast and frugal heuristic uses statistical simulations  to show that they  could  work in some real-life situations, but the evidence for the psychological reality of these heuristics remains thin and contested. The most memorable discovery associated with this approach is the  recognition heuristic, illustrated by an example that has become well-known: a subject who is asked which of two cities is larger and recognizes one of them should guess that the one she recognizes is larger. The recognition heuristic works fairly well if the subject knows that the city she recognizes is large; if she knows it to be small, however, she will quite reasonably guess that the unknown  city is larger. Contrary to the theory, the subjects use more than the recognition cue: Daniel M. Oppenheimer, “Not So Fast! (and Not So Frugal!): Rethinking the Recognition Heuristic,”  Cognition  90 (2003): B1–B9. A weakness of the theory is that, from what we know of the mind, there is no need for heuristics to be frugal. The brain processes vast amounts of information in parallel, and the mind  can be fast and accurate without ignoring information. Furthermore, it has been known since the early days of research on chess masters that skill need not consist of learning to use less information. On the contrary, skill is more often an ability to deal with large amounts of information quickly and efficiently. </p></div>

Todd和ABC研究小组在《 使我们聪明的简单启发式方法 》（纽约：牛津大学出版社，1999年）中提出了另一种判断启发式方法。他们描述了 "快速和节俭 "的正式程序，如 "采取最好的[线索]"，在某些情况下，在很少的信息基础上产生相当准确的判断。正如Gigerenzer所强调的，他的启发式方法与Amos和我研究的那些不同，  ，他强调了它们的准确性，而不是它们不可避免地导致的偏见。支持快速和节俭启发式的大部分研究使用统计模拟 ，以表明它们在一些现实生活中 可以 发挥作用，但这些启发式的心理现实的证据仍然很薄，而且有争议。与这种方法相关的最令人难忘的发现是  识别启发式，通过一个已经众所周知的例子来说明：一个被试如果被问到两个城市中哪个更大，并且认出了其中一个，那么她应该猜到她认出的那个更大。如果受试者知道她所认识的城市是大的，那么识别启发式的效果就相当好；但是如果她知道它是小的，她就会很合理地猜测那个未知的  城市是大的。与理论相反的是，受试者使用的不仅仅是识别线索。丹尼尔-M-奥本海默，"不要那么快!(和不那么节俭！）。重新思考识别启发式，" 认知 90（2003）。B1-B9。该理论的一个弱点是，从我们对心智的了解来看，启发式方法没有必要是节俭的。大脑并行地处理大量的信息，心灵  ，可以在不忽略信息的情况下做到快速和准确。此外，从早期对国际象棋大师的研究开始，人们就知道技能不需要包括学习使用更少的信息。相反，技能更多时候是一种快速和有效地处理大量信息的能力。 </p></div>

When the self-reports of happiness were correlated with the local weather at the time of the interview, a pronounced correlation  was found. Mood is known to vary with the weather, and substitution explains the effect on reported happiness. However, another version of the telephone survey yielded a somewhat different result. These respondents were asked about the current weather before they were asked the happiness question. For them, weather had no effect at all on reported happiness! The explicit priming of weather  provided them with an explanation of their mood, undermining the connection that would normally be made between current mood and overall happiness. </p></div>

Given this, I think the public’s response was rational.” (Personal communication, May 11, 2011.) </p></div>

Consider a problem of diagnosis. Your friend has tested positive for a serious disease. The disease is rare: only 1 in 600 of the cases  sent in for testing actually has the disease. The test is fairly accurate. Its likelihood ratio is 25:1, which means that the probability that a person who has the disease will test positive is 25 times higher than the probability of a false positive. Testing positive is frightening news, but the odds that your friend has the disease have risen only from 1/600 to 25/600, and the probability is  4%. </p></div>

The odds are the ratio of the probability that the cab is Blue, divided by the probability that the cab is Green.

The incoming CEO then gets credit, at least temporarily, for his new firm’s subsequent improvement. (Meanwhile, his replacement at his former firm is now struggling, leading the new bosses to believe that they definitely  hired “the right guy.”) Anytime a CEO jumps ship, the new company must buy out his stake (in stock and options) at his old firm, setting a baseline for future compensation that has nothing to do with performance at the new firm. Tens of millions of dollars in compensation get awarded for “personal” achievements that are driven mainly by regression and halo effects (personal communication, December  29, 2009). </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 向平均值回归 。杰森-茨威格观察到，缺乏对回归的欣赏  ，对招聘首席执行官有不利的影响。陷入困境的公司倾向于求助于外部人士，从近期回报率高的公司招聘CEO。然后，即将上任的首席执行官会因为他的新公司随后的改善而获得荣誉，至少是暂时的。(与此同时，他在前公司的继任者现在也在挣扎，导致新老板相信他们肯定  ，雇用了 "正确的人"）。任何时候CEO跳槽，新公司都必须买断他在旧公司的股份（股票和期权），为未来的报酬设定一个基线，而这与新公司的业绩无关。数以千万美元计的报酬被授予 "个人 "成就，而这些成就主要是由回归和光环效应驱动的（个人通信，2009年12月  29）。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> kouros : The Getty Museum in Los Angeles brings in the world’s leading experts on Greek sculpture to view a kouros—a marble statue of a striding boy—that it is about to buy. One  after another, the experts react with what one calls “intuitive repulsion”—a powerful hunch that the kouros is not 2,500 years old but a modern fake. None of the experts  can immediately say why they think the sculpture is a forgery. The closest any of them could come to a rationale is an Italian art historian’s complaint that something—he does not know exactly what—“seemed wrong” with the statue’s fingernails. A famous American expert said that the first thought that came to his mind was the word  fresh , and a Greek expert flatly stated, “Anyone who has ever seen  a sculpture coming out of the ground could tell that that thing has never been in the ground.” The lack of agreement on the reasons for the shared conclusion is striking, and rather suspect. </p></div>

For example, when Angus Deaton plotted the  average life satisfaction of residents of many countries against the GDP of these countries, he used the logarithm of GDP as a measure of income. The relationship, it turns out, is extremely close: Residents of high-GDP countries are much more satisfied with the quality of their lives than are residents of poor countries, and a doubling of income yields approximately the same increment of satisfaction  in rich and poor countries alike. </p></div>

How much would you pay  for an opportunity to play that game?” People do not think the gamble is worth more than a few dollars, although its expected value is infinite—because the prize keeps growing, the expected value is $1 for each toss, to infinity. However, the utility of the prizes grows much more slowly, which explains why the gamble is not attractive. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> ongoing debate about the endowment effect : Charles R. Plott and Kathryn Zeiler, “The Willingness to Pay–Willingness to Accept Gap, the ‘Endowment Effect,’ Subject Misconceptions, and Experimental Procedures for Eliciting Valuations,”  American  Economic Review  95 (2005): 530–45. Charles Plott, a leading experimental economist, has been very skeptical of the endowment effect and has attempted to show that it is not a “fundamental aspect of human preference” but rather an outcome of inferior technique. Plott and Zeiler believe that participants who show the endowment effect are under some misconception about what their true values are,  and they modified the procedures of the original experiments to eliminate the misconceptions. They devised an elaborate training procedure in which the participants experienced the roles of both buyers and sellers, and were explicitly taught to assess their true values. As expected, the endowment effect disappeared. Plott and Zeiler view their method as an important improvement of technique. Psychologists  would consider the method severely deficient, because it communicates to the participants a message of what the experimenters consider appropriate behavior, which happens to coincide with the experimenters’ theory. Plott and Zeiler’s favored version of Knetsch’s exchange experiment is similarly biased: It does not allow the owner of the good to have physical possession of it, which is crucial  to the effect. See Charles R. Plott and Kathryn Zeiler, “Exchange Asymmetries Incorrectly Interpreted as Evidence of Endowment Effect Theory and Prospect Theory?”  American Economic Review  97 (2007): 1449–66. There may be an impasse here, where each side rejects the methods required by the other. </p></div>

Would you say that you are very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy?” This question is included in the General Social Survey in the United States, and its correlations with other variables suggest a mix of satisfaction and experienced happiness. A pure measure of life evaluation used in the Gallup surveys is the Cantril Self-Anchoring Striving Scale, in which the respondent rates his  or her current life on a ladder scale in which 0 is “the worst possible life for you” and 10 is “the best possible life for you.” The language suggests that people should anchor on what they consider possible for them, but the evidence shows that people all over the world have a common standard for what a good life is, which accounts for the extraordinarily high correlation ( r  = .84) between the  GDP of countries and the average ladder score of their citizens.

<p class ="en"> I am fortunate to have many friends and no shame about asking for help. Every one of my friends has been approached, some of them many times, with requests for information or editorial suggestions. I apologize for not listing them all. A few individuals played a major role in making the book happen. My thanks go first to Jason Zweig, who urged me into the project and patiently  tried to work with me until it became clear to both of us that I am impossible to work with. Throughout, he has been generous with his editorial advice and enviable erudition, and sentences that he suggested dot the book. Roger Lewin turned transcripts of a set of lectures into chapter drafts. Mary Himmelstein provided valuable assistance throughout. John Brockman began as an agent and became a trusted  friend. Ran Hassin provided advice and encouragement when it was most needed. In the final stages of a long journey I had the indispensable help of Eric Chinski, my editor at Farrar, Straus and Giroux. He knew the book better than I did and the work became an enjoyable collaboration—I had not imagined that an editor could do as much as Eric did. My daughter, Lenore Shoham, rallied round to  help me through the hectic final months, providing wisdom, a sharp critical eye, and many of the sentences in the “Speaking of” sections. My wife, Anne Treisman, went through a lot and did a lot—I would have given up long ago without her steady support, wisdom, and endless patience. </p></div>
